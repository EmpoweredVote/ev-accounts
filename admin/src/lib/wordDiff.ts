/**
 * Word-level diff for compass revision review (ADR 0004 §9).
 *
 * Ported from CompassV2 to the accounts admin app, which is where the team's
 * admin panel actually lives. The CompassV2 copy is being removed — two review
 * surfaces for the same queue is the duplication ADR 0004 exists to avoid.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS COMPUTED IN THE BROWSER
 * Revisions are stored as full snapshots, so a diff is a pure function of two
 * strings. Nothing about it needs to be persisted, and computing it here keeps
 * the API free of presentation decisions.
 *
 * WHY WORD-LEVEL AND NOT CHARACTER-LEVEL
 * A character diff on prose produces confetti — it marks the shared letters
 * inside two different words. Reviewers are reading sentences, so the unit is a
 * word.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DECIDE
 * Whether a rung was *reworded* or *replaced* is a semantic question a text
 * differ cannot answer: if every word changed, the two are identical to it. That
 * comes from `rung_map` on the server. This function is only asked to diff pairs
 * the caller has already decided are rewordings.
