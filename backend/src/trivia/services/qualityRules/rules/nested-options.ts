/**
 * Nested Options Quality Rule
 *
 * A multiple-choice question must have exactly one true option. Bounded options
 * ("More than 50", "Fewer than 200", "0-99") break that quietly, because a bound
 * can be true at the same time as another bound.
 *
 * queny-059 shipped as an active easy question offering
 *   "More than 50" / "More than 80" / "More than 138" / "More than 200"
 * with "More than 138" marked correct. If more than 138 languages are spoken in
 * Queens then more than 50 and more than 80 are also true. Three correct answers.
 * No existing rule saw it: the options are four distinct strings, the answer index
 * is valid, and nothing is ambiguous in the wording.
 *
 * This is BLOCKING when more than one option is simultaneously true. That is a
 * correctness defect, not a style one - a player who picks "More than 50" is right
 * and is marked wrong.
 *
 * It is ADVISORY when the options nest but only one happens to be true (the correct
 * option is the weakest bound). Such a question is still confusing to read and the
 * set will become wrong the moment someone edits which option is correct, but it is
 * not scoring anyone incorrectly today.
