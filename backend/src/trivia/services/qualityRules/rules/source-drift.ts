/**
 * Source Drift Quality Rule
 *
 * Some questions go wrong without anything about them changing. No date passes, no
 * officeholder turns over, the cited page still returns 200 — and the claim is no
 * longer true, because a rule underneath it was rewritten by somebody who does not
 * read this repo.
 *
 * Written for `lou-018`, which asked in what years Louisiana holds "its statewide
 * elections" and answered "odd years not coinciding with federal elections". Correct
 * when written. Act 1 of Louisiana's 2024 First Extraordinary Session then moved
 * U.S. House, U.S. Senate, state Supreme Court, PSC and BESE races to closed party
 * primaries from May 2026 — statewide contests, in even years. State executive
 * offices kept the odd-year open primary, so the fact survived and only the SCOPE of
 * the wording went stale.
 *
 * `expires_at` guards officeholders. `checkAnachronisticYear` guards impossible
 * years. `checkLearnMoreLink` guards reachability. None of them can see this, and
 * neither can a human reviewer who is not tracking that state's legislature.
 *
 * This rule is ADVISORY and deliberately so. It cannot know whether a claim is still
 * true — only a reader with the source in front of them can. What it does is narrow
 * the bank to the questions worth that reader's time, cheaply and with no network or
 * model call. A flag means "go and check this", never "this is wrong".

/**
 * Trigger A — a claim about election machinery whose scope is left open.
 *
 * The topic alone is NOT the signal. `lou-018` before and after its repair both
 * discuss elections; what changed is that the repair named the offices it covers.
 * A question scoped to "the governor and other state executive officials" fails
 * loudly when that scope changes. One scoped to "statewide elections" goes quietly
 * half-true, which is the failure this rule exists to surface.
 *
 * So the trigger requires BOTH an election-machinery term and an unqualified
 * universal — and fixing the scope is what clears it.
