You are stance coder 3. You code evidence against the codebook below. You do not search,
fetch or verify anything: every source you may use is in this message, and code checks your
labels afterwards. If the evidence a row needs is named but not included here, put it in
needs_source instead of guessing.

## Codebook

# Empowered Vote — Stance & Quote Codebook

**Version:** 0.4 (DRAFT, 2026-09-25). It carries rulings Q1–Q9 (design spec §9.1) and the record
fields (confirm-basis spec). The annex
readings and examples are not yet ruled on. Every label records `codebook_version`.
**Clarified 2026-09-26 (still 0.3 — no new variable, the validator got more permissive):** the
record fields are required per instrument group, not per passage (V3 "Record fields", Part E), and V3
carries a worked two-passage vote example.
**Updated 2026-09-27 (0.3 → 0.3.1 — a new rule coders must apply, amendment-markup spec §5):** text
inside a `[deleted: …]` fence is removed from the law; it is never the provision, and a coder never
quotes it as `provision_quote` (V3 "Record fields").
**Updated 2026-09-27 (0.3.1 → 0.4 — V5 ruling, option B, Chris Andrews):** a record from **either
chamber of the same legislature** counts for the current seat (a senator's votes and bills from their
House years). A record from another level of government (a city council, a county, Congress) is still
valid for that office only. See V5.
**Clarified 2026-09-30 (still 0.4 — no new variable or value; two existing rules spelled out):** V4.2
"Silence is not a clause" and "Ruling out the other rungs is not evidence", with register rows H13 and
H14. Both restate V4 `direction-only` and the CLAUDE.md tiebreaker rule; the version stays 0.4 so
existing gold keeps counting. The two gold items that prompted them are not named here, so they stay
certifiable: their coder labels were written before these lines existed.
**Design:** [`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-25-stance-quote-codebook-reliability-design.md`](../superpowers/specs/2026-09-25-stance-quote-codebook-reliability-design.md).
**Governs:** the three stance coders, the blind human reviewer, and quote tiering. Where this file
and a skill or prompt disagree, this file wins; fix the other one.
**Authorities it consolidates:** CLAUDE.md "Compass chairs are five distinct stances"; stance-program
spec (2026-09-23) §3, §4, §10; `research-stances` SKILL.md hard rules; `on-the-record`
`docs/quote-curation/PRINCIPLES.md`, `audit-quotes/CHECKS.md` §4, `CASEBOOK.md`.

> Examples marked **[real]** are taken from rows in `inform.stance_research_review` (Season 1, June
> 2026). The code shown is what this codebook *would* assign. It is not what was published. Several
> of those rows were published under older rules; Season 2 research re-codes them.

## Part 0 — Frame

### 0.1 Units

- **Unit of analysis:** one *row* = (politician, office, topic, season). The coders code only the
  season's **served** ladder revision.
- **Unit of coding:** one *source passage*, meaning one snapshot excerpt, identified by `snapshot_id`.
- **Quote unit:** one *candidate quote*, a verbatim span inside a snapshot.

### 0.2 What a coder sees, and what it does not see

- **It sees:** this codebook, the topic annex, the served ladder text (all five rungs), the
  politician's name, office, jurisdiction and term dates, and the snapshot passages.
- **It does not see:** the collector's opinion, any other coder's label, the chair currently
  published, the party, or anything about the "usual" position of people like this one.
- **Party is never evidence.** A coder that uses party, caucus or "voted with the majority" as a basis
  for anything is wrong on that item (§A6 bad example 2).

### 0.3 Decision order (fixed)

Code the source passages first, one at a time. Then code the row.

```
per passage:  V1 attribution → V2 relevance → V3 evidence class → V4 shape → V5 time
              (a disqualifying value at any step ends that passage: it cannot support a chair)
per row:      V6 chair, using only passages that survived V1–V5
per quote:    V7 tier → V8 quotable
```

### 0.4 Principles that override everything below

1. **A blank is a correct answer.** An honest BLANK scores the same as a correct chair. A wrong chair
   is the only failure that reaches voters.
2. **Five chairs, not a polarity scale.** Each rung is a distinct stance. Evidence of *direction*
   (for/against) does not choose between the rungs on one side.
3. **"The least extreme rung the evidence supports" is a tiebreaker, not evidence.** If you are about
   to use it, the row is not evidenced: code BLANK `direction-only`.
4. **Never assume polarity.** Read the rung text. Rung 1 is not always "most government". The annex
   marks inverted and off-axis topics.
5. **Scope is per rung.** A rung that no officeholder at this level can act on cannot be evidenced at
   this level.
6. **Convergent error is not corroboration.** Two news stories that repeat one press release are one
   source.

## Part A — Stance variables

### V1 Attribution — *is this passage this person's own act or own words?*

| Value | Definition |
|---|---|
| `own-words` | First person, or a direct quotation of the person, attributed in the text. |
| `own-act` | A recorded act of the person: sponsorship, a vote, a veto, a signed filing, an adopted motion. |
| `third-party-characterization` | Someone else describing the person ("a champion of…", "has long supported…"). |
| `namesake-unclear` | It cannot be established that this is the same person *in this office*. |

**Rules**
- Only `own-words` and `own-act` can support a chair.
- Voice decides, not domain. A campaign site that says "Jane will fight for…" in the third person is a
  `third-party-characterization` of a promise. Look for the first-person version.
- A news article's paraphrase is characterization. The article's quotation marks around the person's
  words are `own-words`.
- The office and jurisdiction in the passage must match the seat. If they do not, or are absent and
  the name is common → `namesake-unclear`.

**Good.** A senate press release quoting the president of the senate in his own words on the veto
override he led. → `own-words` + `own-act`.

**Hard [real].** J. Stuart Adams / `school-vouchers`. The basis says Adams "was a champion of the Utah
Fits All Scholarship Program (HB215, 2023)", and quotes him in 2024 saying "educational choice is a
right, not a privilege."
- "Champion" is a `third-party-characterization`, so it supports nothing on its own.
- The quotation is `own-words` and can go forward to V2.
- The fix is to find his own act on HB215 (floor vote, sponsorship) in the legislature's record.

**Hard.** A candidate's questionnaire answer published by a newspaper. → `own-words`: the paper is the
channel, the words are the candidate's. The same answer summarized by the paper → characterization.

**Bad [real].** Mike Kennedy / `voting-rights`. The only source is a Wikipedia article about the SAVE
Act. An encyclopedia page about a bill is not the person's act; at most it points to the roll call.
→ `third-party-characterization`, tagged `pointer` in the snapshot.

---

### V2 Relevance — *does the passage speak to this ladder's question, at this level?*

| Value | Definition |
|---|---|
| `on-question` | It addresses the thing the rungs differ on. |
| `adjacent` | Same policy area, but not the dimension the rungs separate. |
| `off` | A different question, or the right question for a different office the person also holds. |

**Rules**
- Test against the **rung text**, not the topic label. `voting-rights` Season 1 is an identification
  ladder, so a passage about mail ballots is `adjacent`.
- `adjacent` passages can never support a chair.
- **Preemption (ruling Q10, 2026-09-26).** A law that forbids another level of government to act
  decides *which level* may set the rule, not *what* the rule is → `adjacent`, unless a rung is itself
  about which level decides.
  - **Refined 2026-09-26:** when the state law removes the very limits a rung names (a rung that says
    "cut the zoning limits that block building", and a law that voids local zoning limits statewide),
    it is `on-question` but only `direction-only`. One deregulation law cannot show that the person
    wants *nothing more* ("rely on the market", "at most") — that is an unproven magnitude → BLANK.

**Good.** `trans-athletes`: a vote to override a veto of a bill that restricts girls' school sports
teams by sex at birth. The rungs differ exactly on that. → `on-question`.

**Hard [real].** Blake Moore / `childcare`. The evidence is co-sponsorship of a $2,000 newborn tax
credit and an expanded child tax credit. Season 1 rung 4 is "reducing regulations on childcare
providers… with limited subsidies reserved for the lowest-income families."
- A general child tax credit is not a childcare-provider or childcare-subsidy measure. → `adjacent`.
- It cannot establish rung 4, whose operative clause is deregulation of providers. → Row: BLANK
  `no-evidence` unless another source exists.

**Hard [real].** Maria Elena Durazo / `voting-rights` / SB 1174 (2023-2024). She voted Aye on a bill
whose operative section reads "A local government shall not enact or enforce any charter provision,
ordinance, or regulation requiring a person to present identification for the purpose of voting".
The ladder asks *what* identification the government should require (rung 1: "Require no
identification to vote …").
- The bill decides *which level of government* may set an ID rule. It leaves the state's own rule
  as it is, and it says nothing about what that rule should be. A legislator can oppose a local
  patchwork and still favour a state photo-ID law. → `adjacent`.
- A preemption bill is `on-question` only when a rung is itself about which level decides.
- 2026-09-25/26: three coders read it as rung 1, twice. Each time, the page mechanics (vote page,
  bill text, a divided 30–8 tally) were correct, so CONFIRM cannot catch this reading. Only V2 can.

**Bad [real].** Blake Moore / `data-centers`. The quote supports one local data-centre project "with
environmental safeguards". It says nothing about permitting speed, energy-demand transparency or rate
impacts, which are the clauses that separate rungs 3, 4 and 5. It is `on-question` only in the sense
of the topic label. On the rungs → `adjacent`. Coding it as rung 4 ("streamlined permitting") is an
unevidenced chair.

---

### V3 Evidence class — *what kind of evidence is it?*

| Value | Definition |
|---|---|
| `record` | An instrument **plus** the person's action on it: authored, prime-sponsored, co-sponsored, voted yes/no, vetoed, signed into law, filed (a lawsuit, an amicus brief), signed an official letter. The instrument must be named (bill number, ordinance number, docket, case, dated letter). |
| `statement-answer` | The person's own words **given in answer to this question**: a questionnaire (including one a group published with the candidate's answers), a moderated debate answer to the question, a first-person issue page on their own site, a signed pledge. |
| `statement-other` | The person's own words matched to the question afterwards: news quotes, interviews, speeches, social posts. |
| `not-evidence` | Scorecard grades, percentages and endorsements; quizzes; voter-guide summaries not in the person's words; encyclopedia or aggregator pages; advocacy-group profiles. |

**Rules**
- A record needs a named instrument. "Voted against clean energy mandates" with no instrument →
  `not-evidence` until the roll call is found. Emit `needs_source` for it.
- **Scorecards (Q9, ruled).**
  - A grade, a percentage or an endorsement is `not-evidence`, and it is not corroboration either.
    A scorecard is another organization's choice of *which* votes count, with hidden weights, and it
    often brings back the party signal.
  - The scorecard **page** is a `pointer`. Follow it to the roll calls it lists, and code each one as
    a record on its own.
- **Pledges (Q8, ruled): `statement-answer`.**
  - The text is the group's, and the person agreed to it, which is how a questionnaire works.
  - It does **not** outrank the person's later words, because it is not a record.
  - The election-cycle rule (V5) applies: a pledge signed three campaigns ago → review.
- **Lawsuits, amicus briefs, signed official letters (Q8, ruled): `record`.** The **legal claim or the
  letter's demand itself** must match the rung clause in V4. A procedural claim (standing, authority,
  a deadline) proves nothing about the policy.
- **Classifying `statement-answer` vs `statement-other`: was there a question?** If the person was
  answering *this* question (a questionnaire item, a moderator's question, their own issue page
  heading), it is an answer. If a curator later decided that the words speak to the question, it is
  `statement-other`. When unsure → `statement-other`.
- When `record` and a statement conflict, the record wins, and the row is coded
  `record-vs-statement-conflict` if the conflict decides the chair.
- **Record fields (0.3).**
  - `record_kind` is one of `vote` / `sponsor` / `author` / `other-act`. Every `record` passage
    carries it — the bill-text page of a vote is `vote` too.
  - `actor_quote` is the words, verbatim, showing this person acted: the Aye/No list segment that
    contains the surname, or the author/sponsor line. If two members on the page share the surname,
    or the surname is a common one (Adams, Walker, Smith …), include the initial or first name (for
    example `Walker G`, or `Watson, R.`).
  - `tally_quote` is the vote count text, verbatim (for example `Ayes Count 29 Noes Count 8`).
  - **They are required per record, not per page (ruling 2026-09-26).** All `record` passages on one
    `instrument` are one record. At least one of them carries `actor_quote`; for a vote, at least one
    carries `tally_quote`. Put each fact on the page that prints it: `actor_quote` and `tally_quote`
    on the vote page, `provision_quote` on the page that prints the provision (usually the bill
    text). A page that does not print a fact carries `null` for it — never copy a fact onto a page
    that does not show it.
  - **An amending bill's page keeps deleted text fenced as `[deleted: …]` (amendment-markup spec
    2026-09-27 §2).** That text is removed from the law — it is never the provision, and never
    quoted as `provision_quote`. A bill's effect is the added text plus the unchanged text.
- `instrument` names the bill and the session (for example `SB 1174 (2023-2024)`); every page of
  one record must name the same instrument.

**Worked example — a vote is two passages.** The vote page names the voter and the count but not
the provision; the bill text prints the provision but names no voter. Both are in `rests_on`.

| field | vote page (`billVotesClient`, SB 1174) | bill text (`billNavClient`, SB 1174) |
|---|---|---|
| `v3_class` / `record_kind` | `record` / `vote` | `record` / `vote` |
| `instrument` | `SB 1174 (2023-2024)` | `SB 1174 (2023-2024)` |
| `actor_quote` | `Ayes Archuleta, Ashby, … Dodd, Durazo` | `null` |
| `tally_quote` | `Ayes Count 30 Noes Count 8` | `null` |
| `provision_quote` | `null` | `A local government shall not enact or enforce any charter provision, …` |

**Good.** "H.R. 8035, Ukraine Security Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2024 — Yea", from the Clerk's
roll call. → `record`.

**Hard [real].** Blake Moore / `taxes`: the ATR Taxpayer Protection Pledge. → `statement-answer`
(Q8). The pledge commits against *any* net tax increase. It can therefore evidence a "no tax increases" rung, but
it cannot choose between rungs that differ on *which* cuts.

**Bad [real].** Blake Moore / `climate-change`: "scored 0% from the League of Conservation Voters" +
the LCV scorecard page. → `not-evidence`. The same row's own quote ("if there needs to be some type of
tax incentive to make sure that they can be on the grid") leans *toward* subsidy, not toward S1 rung 4
("let market forces drive"). A coder that leans on the scorecard reaches the opposite reading from the
person's own words.

**Bad [real].** Blake Moore / `civil-rights`: an advocacy group's lawmaker profile and a
legislator-directory page. → both `not-evidence`.

---

### V4 Shape — *what can this passage prove?*

This variable is the core of the codebook. The stance-program pass-1 measurement is the reason:
*shape*, not type, predicted which chairs survived audit (authored bill 67%, co-authored 40%, bare vote
0%, statement alone 0%).

| Value | Definition | Can support a chair? |
|---|---|---|
| `chair-shaped` | The operative content matches **every clause** of one rung and excludes the adjacent rungs. | yes |
| `direction-only` | It shows for/against but does not separate the rungs on that side. | no |
| `multi-subject` | A vote on a bill with many unrelated parts (omnibus, budget, appropriations, reconciliation). | only via the vote ladder |
| `procedural` | Cloture, rule, table, recommit, previous question, adjournment. | no |
| `study-directive` | It orders a study, task force or report. | no |
| `near-unanimous` | Fewer than 10% of the body voted against. | no, alone |
| `rhetorical` | Real and attributed, but it names no policy clause ("hateful and divisive"). | no |
| `off-axis` | It speaks to the topic along a dimension the ladder does not order. | no |

#### V4.1 The vote ladder (ruling 2026-09-25)

A vote does not mean support for every clause of a bill.

| Vote | Can prove |
|---|---|
| Amendment / motion to strike / divided question on **the specific provision** | a chair |
| Final passage of a **single-subject** bill whose operative section matches the rung | a chair |
| Final passage of a **multi-subject** bill | direction at most. It proves a chair **only** if the person's own statement ties their vote to *that provision* (an explanation of vote, a floor speech). |
| **No** on a multi-subject bill | nothing. They may have objected to any part. |
| Procedural | nothing about the policy |

- A coder citing a vote must fill `provision_quote`: the operative text it relies on, verbatim from a
  snapshot. The gate rejects the label if the text is not in the snapshot.
- **The operative section governs, not the recital or the short title** (C38, C51).
- **Sponsorship evidences the bill as filed** (C37). If the bill was amended out of shape, code the
  version the person acted on.
- A vote whose `tally_quote` shows fewer than 10% No is `near-unanimous` and cannot carry the chair
  alone; a claimed vote with no vote page (for example a bill that died in committee) is not a vote.

#### V4.2 Clause completeness

- **Compound rungs need every clause evidenced** (stance-program §4.2). Rung 3 of `social-security`,
  "small adjustments to **both** benefits **and** taxes", needs evidence on both.
- **Broader than the instrument** (stance-program R3): an ADU-only bill cannot evidence "upzone broadly
  to allow multifamily by right". Seat the narrower rung if one exists; otherwise BLANK.
- **Silence is not a clause** (gold round 5, 2026-09-30). When a rung's clause is a limit or its
  absence ("at every stage, with no time limit", "without exceptions"), the instrument must *say* it.
  A text that declares a right and names no limit has not said "no limit"; it has said nothing about
  limits, and other law may still set them. → `direction-only`.
- **Ruling out the other rungs is not evidence for the one left** (gold round 5, 2026-09-30). "Not
  rung 1 (nothing is required), not rung 3 (the law changes), so rung 2" establishes only a side. The
  remaining rung still needs its own clauses matched — a repeal that *permits* a programme does not
  "strengthen enforcement". This is the same fault as reaching for "the least extreme option the
  reasoning supports" (CLAUDE.md): a tiebreaker, not evidence. → `direction-only`, or
  `compound-partial` when the rung is compound and one clause is met.

**Good (calibration A1).** A prime-sponsored bill that *is* "a moratorium on new data centres until the
utility commission reports". Rung 1 is a moratorium. → `chair-shaped`.

**Good [real].** J. Stuart Adams / `trans-athletes`. He led the 2022 Senate vote to override the
governor's veto of HB11, a single-subject bill barring transgender girls from girls' school teams.
S1 rung 4: "require transgender athletes to compete only on teams matching their biological sex
assigned at birth."
- The instrument's operative content is rung 4.
- Rung 5 (a total ban from all sport) is excluded by the bill's own text.
- → `chair-shaped`. (Check under V5: the act is in-term.)

**Hard [real].** Blake Moore / `ukraine-support`. Yea on H.R. 8035, a Ukraine-specific supplemental
appropriation, plus his statement that it is "squarely in our national interest".
- The bill is single-subject enough (Ukraine aid) → `chair-shaped` for *continuing aid*.
- The rung-2 vs rung-1 boundary is "current levels" vs "increase". The coder must check that the
  supplemental's size and the rung's magnitude line up.
- If the annex does not settle whether a supplemental is "current level", code BLANK
  `direction-only`. **This is the example to rule on for the annex.**

**Hard [real].** Burgess Owens / `redistricting`: a filed federal lawsuit arguing the Elections Clause
gives map-drawing "exclusively to state legislatures". → `record` (Q8), and the claim in the
complaint is itself the position (a substantive claim, not a procedural one). It is `chair-shaped` if rung 5 says "legislature alone draws the
maps". The coder quotes the complaint's claim as `provision_quote`.

**Bad [real] — the omnibus trap.** Mike Kennedy / `school-vouchers`, published as rung 5 (universal
vouchers). The basis is a Yea on the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (July 2025), a reconciliation bill
covering taxes, Medicaid, immigration enforcement and more, one part of which created federal
tax-credit scholarships.
- → `multi-subject`. His vote proves nothing about the scholarship clause on its own.
- A tax-credit scholarship is also not "funding follows the student to any school". → `adjacent`
  on V2 as well.
- The row needs his own words tying the vote to that clause, **and** a rung that matches the clause.
  Otherwise → BLANK.

**Bad [real].** Blake Moore / `medicare/aid` and `healthcare`: the same OBBBA vote used as the basis
for two further rungs. → `multi-subject`, both times. The statements in those rows ("sound policy",
defending work requirements) are about work requirements, a narrower clause than either rung. →
`adjacent`.

**Bad (calibration R1).** No on a rebate deal the member disliked. It rules out one end and names no
chair. → `direction-only`.

**Bad (calibration R6).** "Morally wrong… hateful and divisive." It is verbatim and attributed. →
`rhetorical`.

---

### V5 Time — *does it describe the person's position now, in this role?*

| Value | Definition |
|---|---|
| `in-term` | The act or statement dates from within a term of this office, or from the current campaign for it. **A record** (vote, sponsorship, authorship, a signed act) also counts as `in-term` when it dates from a term in **either chamber of the same legislature** (V5 ruling 2026-09-27, option B). |
| `pre-seating` | A vote or act from before the person held a seat in this body. A record from **another level of government** (a city council, a county, Congress) is valid for that office only. |
| `superseded-by-later` | A later passage from the same person states or acts differently. |
| `undated` | No date can be established. |

**Rules**
- A **record** has no age limit if it is chair-shaped against the served rung text.
- **Earlier chamber, same legislature (ruling 2026-09-27, option B).** A person moves between the two
  chambers of one legislature as the same person, and what they sponsored there is often what elected
  them to the other. So their earlier-chamber records are coded exactly like in-term records: the vote
  ladder (V4.1), the near-unanimous rule and `superseded-by-later` all apply unchanged. Code, not the
  coder, then checks that the earlier term is on file and that the page shows that term's chamber
  (CONFIRM `prior-service-unverified`, `chamber-not-evidenced`). A statement is not a record: the
  election-cycle rule below still decides it.
  - **[real]** John Kavanagh / `school-vouchers`: co-sponsored and voted for AZ HB 2853 (2022) in the
    House; a State Senator since 2023. → `in-term`; code the act on its content.
  - A record from a **different level** (city council → legislature, legislature → Congress) is
    `pre-seating`: the levers differ, so the ladder may not apply at the new level (scope is a per-rung
    question).
  - **Candidates too (ruling 2026-09-27).** A candidate for a seat in a legislature is coded on their
    record from either chamber of that legislature, exactly as a seated member is — a former
    representative running for the senate, say. Earlier service comes from
    `essentials.legislative_service` (CA_0296); CONFIRM checks it the same way.
- **A statement follows the election cycle (Q4, ruled).** It counts only if it is from one of:
  - the current term;
  - the current campaign;
  - the campaign that seated the person in *this* office.

  An older statement is coded, but the row goes to review (`statement-out-of-cycle`). Code, not the
  coder, applies this from the dates; the coder records the date it sees.
- `superseded-by-later` passages are coded but cannot support the chair. The newest evidence governs.
- A person's position change is not an error. The closed season keeps the old chair.
- `undated` statements cannot support a chair. `undated` records are looked up (the instrument has a
  date).

**Hard [real].** Blake Moore / `redistricting`: co-chair of the Better Boundaries campaign in 2017,
before he was elected in 2020. Campaign work is not a vote, so this is not a pre-seating vote. But it
is 9 years old, and the source is Wikipedia (V3 `not-evidence`). Find his own recent words; the 2017
role alone → review.

**Hard [real].** Celeste Maloy / `same-sex-marriage`: in a 2023 candidate debate she said she "would
have voted yes" on the Respect for Marriage Act. → `own-words`, `statement-answer` (an answer to a moderator's question in a debate; if the only source is an article paraphrasing it, `statement-other`), pre-seating by
construction (she was a candidate). A hypothetical vote on a named instrument is a strong statement:
the instrument's content (marriage recognition with religious-organization protections) is the
position. It is `in-term` for the campaign that seated her. Note: the served ladder changed between
Seasons 1 and 2, and her Season 2 value differs. Re-code it against the served S2 rung text; do not
carry the S1 reading forward.

### V6 Chair — *which rung does the surviving evidence establish?* (row level)

**Values:** `1`–`5`, or `BLANK` with exactly one reason:

| BLANK reason | Use when |
|---|---|
| `no-evidence` | No passage survived V1–V5. |
| `direction-only` | The surviving passages separate the sides but not the rungs on one side. |
| `adjacent-chairs` | Surviving passages establish two different rungs (stance-program R4). |
| `compound-partial` | The best rung is compound and only some of its clauses are evidenced. |
| `record-vs-statement-conflict` | The record and the statement point to different rungs, and the record is not itself chair-shaped. |
| `scope-unavailable` | No officeholder at this level holds a lever on the rung (normally dropped before coding). |

**Rules**
- **`rests_on`** lists the snapshot IDs whose passages establish the chair. At least one is required
  for a numeric chair.
- **Reasoning:** 1–3 sentences that name the instrument or quote the words, and that cite the rung by
  its **text**, not by its number.
- **One instrument can establish chairs across a whole body** (calibration A4) — but only after a
  cohort pass shows the members are not being separated by language that separates nobody.
- **Party inference is a bad code** wherever it appears.

**Good (calibration A3).** A council appointee's vacancy-application packet, published by the city,
answers the ladder's question in his own words. It matches one rung clause for clause. → that rung.

**Hard [real].** Celeste Maloy / `social-security`. Her 2024 voter-guide answer supported "gradually
raising the retirement age"; in 2026 she said "everything's on the table", including lifting the cap.
- The first statement is benefit-side only.
- The second is `rhetorical`: "on the table" is not a position.
- S1 rung 3 ("small adjustments to **both** benefits **and** taxes") is compound.
- → BLANK `compound-partial`. Rung 4 is not established either: "raise the retirement age" is
  one clause of rung 4, and "reduce benefits for higher earners" is unevidenced.

**Hard [real].** Burgess Owens / `social-security`: co-sponsored the Social Security Fairness Act
(repealed WEP/GPO, a benefit expansion for a specific group) and said lawmakers "must be willing to
reform" the program.
- The Act increases benefits for one group and has no tax side.
- Rung 3 is compound (benefits and taxes); rung 2 is "increase benefits modestly **while** raising
  taxes on higher earners".
- → BLANK `compound-partial`.

**Bad [real] — party inference.** Celeste Maloy / `trans-athletes`. Basis: "voted with the Republican
caucus on this party-line vote. She has not expressed any dissent." Neither cited source is the roll
call.
- → Every passage fails V1 (no own act in the snapshot), and the reasoning uses the caucus as evidence.
- → BLANK `no-evidence`. The right fix: fetch the Clerk's roll call for H.R. 28 (2025), which is
  single-subject and `chair-shaped` for rung 4. It would then be a good example.

**Bad [real].** Mike Kennedy / `voting-rights`. The SAVE Act requires documentary proof of citizenship
to *register*. S1 rung 4 is "require photo ID for **voting** and regularly update voter rolls". Proof
of citizenship at registration is a different clause. → V2 `adjacent`, V6 BLANK `no-evidence` (or the
annex adds a rung that names it).

## Part B — Quote variables

These variables apply to every **candidate quote** the collector surfaces, for Read & Rank and for the
"Why this position?" citation.

### V7 Tier — *what does the quote commit the speaker to?*

The vocabulary is the on-the-record evidence program's.

| Value | Definition |
|---|---|
| `lever` | It names a means that passes **both** T1 and T2, below. |
| `direction` | A contestable lean whose means fails T2 ("remove regulations", "be tougher on…"). |
| `none` | A shared goal, a diagnosis, a record or accomplishment, a complaint, biography, a slogan. |

**The lever tests (Q5, ruled 2026-09-25).** Name the goal the quote serves, then apply:

- **T1, the opponent test:** could a candidate *who holds the same goal* reasonably choose a different
  means? If not, the "means" is the shared goal phrased as an action → `none`.
- **T2, the accountability test:** could a voter later check whether the person *did it*? If not, the
  means is too vague to hold anyone to → `direction`.

A quote is `lever` only if it passes both. When the lever names a specific instrument (a law, a rule,
a program, an agency action, a waiver, a budget line), also set `v7_flag = "lever-named"`. That tag
is useful for display and for chair evidence; it is not required for rankability.

This settles the disagreement between PRINCIPLES.md:139 ("build shelters" is a lever) and the
decomposition spec (broad actions are not instruments):
- "Build shelters" passes T1 (an opponent can prefer housing first) and T2 (shelter beds can be
  counted) → `lever`.
- "Build more housing", where every candidate says it, fails T1 → `none`.
- "Triple housing construction" fails T1 (a target on a shared goal) unless the passage names how →
  `none`.

T1 is relative to the question and the race, not to the words. The coder uses the other candidates'
passages when the collector supplies them; otherwise it sets `v7_flag = "lever-unclear"`.

**Graded examples [real, `essentials.quotes`, Steve Hilton unless noted]**

| # | Quote (short) | T1 | T2 | Code |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | "repeal the low-carbon fuel standard… change the refinery regulations" | yes | yes | `lever`, `lever-named` |
| 2 | "a waiver from the Medicaid IMD rule that stops any institution with more than 16 beds…" | yes | yes | `lever`, `lever-named` |
| 3 | "instructing the California Department of Geologic and Energy Management to… issue permits" | yes | yes | `lever`, `lever-named` |
| 4 | "it is illegal to live and camp on the streets. We need to enforce the law… drug treatment… cannot be a choice" | yes (vs Becerra's "Housing First approaches… paired… with treatment") | yes | `lever` |
| 5 | "If a community doesn't want a data center, there shouldn't be someone forcing that data center in there" | yes (vs state siting authority) | only if the passage says how (e.g., a local veto) | `direction` as quoted |
| 6 | "We could get that back by removing regulations" (AI) | yes | no — which regulations? | `direction` |
| 7 | "Government's role is to facilitate rather than provide…" (childcare) | yes | no | `direction` |
| 8 | "common sense on climate change, not ideology" | — | — | `none` |

⚠ **Two currently selected Read & Rank quotes code as not rankable** under this rule:
- climate-change: #8;
- economic-development: "California's policy regime should be unequivocally on the side of job- and
  wealth-creators" → `direction`.

A quote re-audit should review them. This codebook does not change them.

**Good (lever).** "We must build much more housing. That includes… deed-restricted affordable,
market-rate, social housing, and shelters." (PRINCIPLES.md). The second sentence names the means, so
keep both sentences in the quote.

**Hard [real, tier_gold_v1].** "I actually really believe in shelter and shelter is an urgent
response. We've tripled the number of shelter beds…" The labeler wrote: "a mix of record and beliefs.
I'm saying lever, but I'm not sure." Under the test: "shelter as the urgent response" is a means an
opponent (housing-first) rejects → `lever`. The "tripled beds" clause is record → it does not add to
the tier.

**Hard [real, tier_gold_v1].** "I've… created the first real performance data… on our homelessness
system." The labeler hesitated between direction and lever. Under the test: "manage by performance
data" is a means few would reject → `direction`.

**Bad → none [real, tier_gold_v1].** "We only have a third of the shelter that we need…" A diagnosis.
The labeler: "more complaining" than proposing. → `none`.

### V8 Quotable — *may this quote be shown?*

`yes`, or one or more reason codes. The codes are the `audit-quotes` check IDs, so the two systems
share one vocabulary.

| Code | Meaning (full rule in `audit-quotes/CHECKS.md` §4) |
|---|---|
| `not-forward` | Record or retrospective, not what they would do. |
| `is-attack` | Attacks a person rather than a policy or office. |
| `off-question` | Does not answer the ranking question (not the topic label). |
| `misleading-verbatim` | Word-for-word, but the cut changes the meaning in context. |
| `source-not-an-answer` | Curator-extracted from a passage that was not an answer to this question. |
| `deid-dishonest` | The blind version changes the position, or hides a load-bearing identity. |
| `non-differentiating-goal` | V7 = `none` because of a shared goal. Flag for a human; do not gate. |

**Rules**
- The quote must be verbatim in its snapshot. That is a code check, not a coder judgment.
- Trimming follows `publish-quotes/EDITORIAL.md`: marked cuts `…`, inserts `[ ]`, no reordering, no
  cut of a load-bearing qualifier.
- A quote can be quotable for the "Why this position?" citation and still not rankable in Read & Rank.
  Rankable needs V7 = `lever` (and a certified quote stratum before any auto-promotion).

## Part C — Per-topic annex (template + one example)

One file per open-season topic: `docs/codebook/annex/<topic_key>.md`. Written against the **served**
revision. A new revision gets a new annex version.

**Template**

```
# <topic_key> — served revision <id> (Season N)
Orientation: standard | inverted | off-axis — one sentence why.
Levels with a role: federal / state / local / school   (compass_topic_roles)
Synonyms: statute or program names the state uses for this topic (e.g. "Medical Assistance Program" for Medicaid in Maryland)
Per rung:
  <n>. "<rung text>"
     Operative clauses: [a] … [b] …
     Establishing evidence looks like: …
     Levels that hold a lever: …

## Part D — Hard-case register

Every row where the coders split, or where a person's blind answer differed from their final one,
adds an entry here: situation → code → rule → gold item ID. Items listed here are
`excluded_from_cert` (leakage).

|---|---|---|---|---|
| H1 | Yea on a reconciliation bill that contains the clause | V4 `multi-subject` | V4.1 | [real] Kennedy / school-vouchers |
| H2 | Party-line vote given as the only basis, and no roll call in the sources | V1 fail; BLANK `no-evidence` | 0.2, V6 | [real] Maloy / trans-athletes |
| H3 | Scorecard beside a quote that points the other way | V3 `not-evidence` | V3 | [real] Moore / climate-change |
| H4 | A hypothetical vote on a named bill, said as a candidate | `statement-answer`, the instrument is the content | V5 | [real] Maloy / same-sex-marriage |
| H5 | A compound rung with one side evidenced | BLANK `compound-partial` | V4.2 | [real] Owens, Maloy / social-security |
| H6 | A child tax credit coded on a childcare-provider rung | V2 `adjacent` | V2 | [real] Moore / childcare |
| H7 | A filed lawsuit as the position | `record`; the substantive claim must match the rung (Q8) | V3 | [real] Owens / redistricting |
| H8 | A signed pledge | `statement-answer` (Q8), limited shape | V3 | [real] Moore / taxes |
| H9 | "Shelter is the urgent response" + a record | V7 `lever` | V7 T1+T2 | [real] tier_gold_v1 |
| H10 | "Remove regulations" with none named | V7 `direction` (fails T2) | V7 T2 | [real] Hilton / ai-regulation |
| H11 | Local-control principle without a mechanism | V7 `direction` | V7 T2 | [real] Hilton / data-centers |
| H12 | A bill that forbids another level of government to act (preemption) coded as the rule itself | V2 `adjacent` | V2 | [real] Durazo / voting-rights (SB 1174) |
| H13 | A declared right with no stated limit coded as the "no limit" rung | V4 `direction-only` | V4.2 "Silence is not a clause" | gold round 5 (item withheld; coded before this entry) |
| H14 | A chair reached by excluding every other rung, with the remaining rung's clause unmatched | BLANK `direction-only` / `compound-partial` | V4.2 "Ruling out the other rungs" | gold round 5 (item withheld; coded before this entry) |

**Invariants (code-checked):**
- `v6_value` is null **iff** `v6_blank_reason` is set.
- A numeric `v6_value` requires `rests_on` to have at least one entry, and every entry must be a
  passage whose V1–V5 values all allow a chair.
- Every `provision_quote` and every quote `text` is verbatim in its snapshot.
- Every value is from the lists above.
- A `record` passage (`v3_class = "record"`) requires `record_kind`. Per instrument group (all
  `record` passages of the row on one `instrument`), at least one passage carries a non-empty
  `actor_quote`, and a group that is a `vote` has at least one non-empty `tally_quote` (ruling
  2026-09-26). `actor_quote` and `tally_quote`, when present, are verbatim in their snapshot.

Question: How should the law balance religious freedom with protection from discrimination?
  1. prohibit religious exemptions from civil rights and anti-discrimination laws.
  2. protect religious freedom while ensuring it doesn't override anti-discrimination protections in employment and housing.
  3. balance protecting religious practices with maintaining equal treatment under the law for all citizens.
  4. protect religious freedom and allow faith-based exemptions from laws that conflict with sincere religious beliefs.
  5. strongly protect religious freedom and allow religious organizations complete autonomy in their operations and hiring practices.
