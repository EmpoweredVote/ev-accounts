## Codebook

# Empowered Vote — Stance & Quote Codebook

**Version:** 0.4 (DRAFT, 2026-09-25). It carries rulings Q1–Q9 (design spec §9.1) and the record
fields (confirm-basis spec). The annex
readings and examples are not yet ruled on. Every label records `codebook_version`.
**Clarified 2026-09-26 (still 0.3 — no new variable, the validator got more permissive):** the
record fields are required per instrument group, not per passage (V3 "Record fields", Part E), and V3
carries a worked two-passage vote example.
**Updated 2026-09-27 (0.3 → 0.3.1 — a new rule coders must apply, amendment-markup spec §5):** text
inside a `[deleted: …]` fence is removed from the law; it is never the provision, and a coder never
quotes it as `provision_quote` (V3 "Record fields").
**Updated 2026-09-27 (0.3.1 → 0.4 — V5 ruling, option B, Chris Andrews):** a record from **either
chamber of the same legislature** counts for the current seat (a senator's votes and bills from their
House years). A record from another level of government (a city council, a county, Congress) is still
valid for that office only. See V5.
**Clarified 2026-09-30 (still 0.4 — no new variable or value; two existing rules spelled out):** V4.2
"Silence is not a clause" and "Ruling out the other rungs is not evidence", with register rows H13 and
H14. Both restate V4 `direction-only` and the CLAUDE.md tiebreaker rule; the version stays 0.4 so
existing gold keeps counting. The two gold items that prompted them are not named here, so they stay
certifiable: their coder labels were written before these lines existed.
**Clarified 2026-10-01 (still 0.4 — no new variable or value; rulings by Chris Andrews):** V5 says
how a judge's lower-court record is coded (`pre-seating`, with one lever-match exception), and the
Maloy / `same-sex-marriage` example now reads the RFMA on its operative section (recognition → rung 2;
its religious section is a savings clause). The version stays 0.4 so existing labels and gold keep
counting; no gold item turns on either line.
**Clarified 2026-10-02 (still 0.4 — no new variable or value):** V3 "A record reported only by news is
not a record", with register row H15. It restates the V3 rule that a record needs the instrument and
the person's action on it, for the case where the only source of that action is a reporter's sentence.
The items that prompted it are not named here, for the same reason as H13 and H14.
**Clarified 2026-10-02 (still 0.4 — no new variable or value; ruling by Chris Andrews):** V4 "A study
directive that states its goal", with register row H16. It decides which existing blank reason a
`study-directive` row takes; it changes no chair. The item that prompted it is not named here.
**Clarified 2026-10-02 (still 0.4 — no new variable or value; ruling by Chris Andrews):** V4.2 "The rung's
object is a clause", with register row H17 and its `climate-change` example. The items that prompted it
are not named here.
**Clarified 2026-10-06 (still 0.4 — no new coded variable; ruling by Chris Andrews):** V6 "Evidence
tier". A chair may still rest on one source, but every published chair carries a tier — `single-source`
or `corroborated` — that code computes from `rests_on`. Coders code exactly as before.
**Updated 2026-10-06 (still 0.4 — ruling by Chris Andrews, option B "positions without a lever"):**
scope now decides **which evidence counts**, not whether a chair can exist. Every level is asked every
topic unless an exclusion is named; at a level with no lever, only the person's own words can seat a
chair (V2 "No-lever level"). `scope-unavailable` narrows to the named exclusions (V6). Code computes
the row's evidence basis, never the coder. The version stays 0.4: no recorded gold turns on the change
(the two `scope-unavailable` gold rows are `excluded_from_cert`), and own-words rows form their own
stratum with no gold yet. Memo: `.planning/todos/2026-10-06-positions-without-a-lever.md` (workspace
root).
**Design:** [`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-25-stance-quote-codebook-reliability-design.md`](../superpowers/specs/2026-09-25-stance-quote-codebook-reliability-design.md).
**Governs:** the three stance coders, the blind human reviewer, and quote tiering. Where this file
and a skill or prompt disagree, this file wins; fix the other one.
**Authorities it consolidates:** CLAUDE.md "Compass chairs are five distinct stances"; stance-program
spec (2026-09-23) §3, §4, §10; `research-stances` SKILL.md hard rules; `on-the-record`
`docs/quote-curation/PRINCIPLES.md`, `audit-quotes/CHECKS.md` §4, `CASEBOOK.md`.

> Examples marked **[real]** are taken from rows in `inform.stance_research_review` (Season 1, June
> 2026). The code shown is what this codebook *would* assign. It is not what was published. Several
> of those rows were published under older rules; Season 2 research re-codes them.

## Part 0 — Frame

### 0.1 Units

- **Unit of analysis:** one *row* = (politician, office, topic, season). The coders code only the
  season's **served** ladder revision.
- **Unit of coding:** one *source passage*, meaning one snapshot excerpt, identified by `snapshot_id`.
- **Quote unit:** one *candidate quote*, a verbatim span inside a snapshot.

### 0.2 What a coder sees, and what it does not see

- **It sees:** this codebook, the topic annex, the served ladder text (all five rungs), the
  politician's name, office, jurisdiction and term dates, and the snapshot passages.
- **It does not see:** the collector's opinion, any other coder's label, the chair currently
  published, the party, or anything about the "usual" position of people like this one.
- **Party is never evidence.** A coder that uses party, caucus or "voted with the majority" as a basis
  for anything is wrong on that item (§A6 bad example 2).

### 0.3 Decision order (fixed)

Code the source passages first, one at a time. Then code the row.

```
per passage:  V1 attribution → V2 relevance → V3 evidence class → V4 shape → V5 time
              (a disqualifying value at any step ends that passage: it cannot support a chair)
per row:      V6 chair, using only passages that survived V1–V5
per quote:    V7 tier → V8 quotable
```

### 0.4 Principles that override everything below

1. **A blank is a correct answer.** An honest BLANK scores the same as a correct chair. A wrong chair
   is the only failure that reaches voters.
2. **Five chairs, not a polarity scale.** Each rung is a distinct stance. Evidence of *direction*
   (for/against) does not choose between the rungs on one side.
3. **"The least extreme rung the evidence supports" is a tiebreaker, not evidence.** If you are about
   to use it, the row is not evidenced: code BLANK `direction-only`.
4. **Never assume polarity.** Read the rung text. Rung 1 is not always "most government". The annex
   marks inverted and off-axis topics.
5. **Scope decides the evidence, per rung (ruling 2026-10-06, option B).** A record needs a lever: a
   rung that no officeholder at this level can act on cannot be evidenced at this level by a record.
   It can still be evidenced by the person's own words (V2 "No-lever level"). A voter may want to
   know a mayor's view on abortion even though she cannot change the law.
6. **Convergent error is not corroboration.** Two news stories that repeat one press release are one
   source.

## Part A — Stance variables

### V1 Attribution — *is this passage this person's own act or own words?*

| Value | Definition |
|---|---|
| `own-words` | First person, or a direct quotation of the person, attributed in the text. |
| `own-act` | A recorded act of the person: sponsorship, a vote, a veto, a signed filing, an adopted motion. |
| `third-party-characterization` | Someone else describing the person ("a champion of…", "has long supported…"). |
| `namesake-unclear` | It cannot be established that this is the same person *in this office*. |

**Rules**
- Only `own-words` and `own-act` can support a chair.
- Voice decides, not domain. A campaign site that says "Jane will fight for…" in the third person is a
  `third-party-characterization` of a promise. Look for the first-person version.
- A news article's paraphrase is characterization. The article's quotation marks around the person's
  words are `own-words`.
- The office and jurisdiction in the passage must match the seat. If they do not, or are absent and
  the name is common → `namesake-unclear`.

**Good.** A senate press release quoting the president of the senate in his own words on the veto
override he led. → `own-words` + `own-act`.

**Hard [real].** J. Stuart Adams / `school-vouchers`. The basis says Adams "was a champion of the Utah
Fits All Scholarship Program (HB215, 2023)", and quotes him in 2024 saying "educational choice is a
right, not a privilege."
- "Champion" is a `third-party-characterization`, so it supports nothing on its own.
- The quotation is `own-words` and can go forward to V2.
- The fix is to find his own act on HB215 (floor vote, sponsorship) in the legislature's record.

**Hard.** A candidate's questionnaire answer published by a newspaper. → `own-words`: the paper is the
channel, the words are the candidate's. The same answer summarized by the paper → characterization.

**Bad [real].** Mike Kennedy / `voting-rights`. The only source is a Wikipedia article about the SAVE
Act. An encyclopedia page about a bill is not the person's act; at most it points to the roll call.
→ `third-party-characterization`, tagged `pointer` in the snapshot.

---

### V2 Relevance — *does the passage speak to this ladder's question, at this level?*

| Value | Definition |
|---|---|
| `on-question` | It addresses the thing the rungs differ on. |
| `adjacent` | Same policy area, but not the dimension the rungs separate. |
| `off` | A different question, or the right question for a different office the person also holds. |

**Rules**
- Test against the **rung text**, not the topic label. `voting-rights` Season 1 is an identification
  ladder, so a passage about mail ballots is `adjacent`.
- `adjacent` passages can never support a chair.
- **Preemption (ruling Q10, 2026-09-26).** A law that forbids another level of government to act
  decides *which level* may set the rule, not *what* the rule is → `adjacent`, unless a rung is itself
  about which level decides.
  - **Refined 2026-09-26:** when the state law removes the very limits a rung names (a rung that says
    "cut the zoning limits that block building", and a law that voids local zoning limits statewide),
    it is `on-question` but only `direction-only`. One deregulation law cannot show that the person
    wants *nothing more* ("rely on the market", "at most") — that is an unproven magnitude → BLANK.

- **No-lever level (ruling 2026-10-06, Chris Andrews, option B).** Read the annex line "Levels that
  hold a lever" for the rung. If the seat's level is not listed there, the level holds no lever on
  that rung, and **only the person's own words** (V3 `statement-answer` or `statement-other`) can
  support it. The prompt also says so per topic ("Evidence basis at this seat's level: OWN WORDS
  ONLY") when no rung of the topic has a lever at that level.
  - An act of this office on such a rung cannot enact it. A vote or bill at this level is coded on
    what its text does, against the rung's clauses; a law on a neighbouring matter is `adjacent`, as
    anywhere else (no example is given here: the item that prompted this rule is to be re-labelled
    blind). A resolution that only urges another level to act is V4 `rhetorical`, unless its text
    states every clause of one rung.
    _owed:_ whether a member's vote for a resolution that states every clause of a rung counts as
    their own words (statement class) or stays a record that cannot seat a chair at a no-lever level.
    Until ruled: code it `statement-other` and let the row go to review.
  - A record from another level stays `pre-seating` (V5); it is not this person's act in this office.
  - The election-cycle rule (V5, Q4) applies unchanged.
  - **Not** this rule: a level the topic is not asked at all (no `compass_topic_roles` row, or a
    named exclusion). That row is not coded; V6 `scope-unavailable`.

**Good.** `trans-athletes`: a vote to override a veto of a bill that restricts girls' school sports
teams by sex at birth. The rungs differ exactly on that. → `on-question`.

**Hard [real].** Blake Moore / `childcare`. The evidence is co-sponsorship of a $2,000 newborn tax
credit and an expanded child tax credit. Season 1 rung 4 is "reducing regulations on childcare
providers… with limited subsidies reserved for the lowest-income families."
- A general child tax credit is not a childcare-provider or childcare-subsidy measure. → `adjacent`.
- It cannot establish rung 4, whose operative clause is deregulation of providers. → Row: BLANK
  `no-evidence` unless another source exists.

**Hard [real].** Maria Elena Durazo / `voting-rights` / SB 1174 (2023-2024). She voted Aye on a bill
whose operative section reads "A local government shall not enact or enforce any charter provision,
ordinance, or regulation requiring a person to present identification for the purpose of voting".
The ladder asks *what* identification the government should require (rung 1: "Require no
identification to vote …").
- The bill decides *which level of government* may set an ID rule. It leaves the state's own rule
  as it is, and it says nothing about what that rule should be. A legislator can oppose a local
  patchwork and still favour a state photo-ID law. → `adjacent`.
- A preemption bill is `on-question` only when a rung is itself about which level decides.
- 2026-09-25/26: three coders read it as rung 1, twice. Each time, the page mechanics (vote page,
  bill text, a divided 30–8 tally) were correct, so CONFIRM cannot catch this reading. Only V2 can.

**Bad [real].** Blake Moore / `data-centers`. The quote supports one local data-centre project "with
environmental safeguards". It says nothing about permitting speed, energy-demand transparency or rate
impacts, which are the clauses that separate rungs 3, 4 and 5. It is `on-question` only in the sense
of the topic label. On the rungs → `adjacent`. Coding it as rung 4 ("streamlined permitting") is an
unevidenced chair.

---

### V3 Evidence class — *what kind of evidence is it?*

| Value | Definition |
|---|---|
| `record` | An instrument **plus** the person's action on it: authored, prime-sponsored, co-sponsored, voted yes/no, vetoed, signed into law, filed (a lawsuit, an amicus brief), signed an official letter. The instrument must be named (bill number, ordinance number, docket, case, dated letter). |
| `statement-answer` | The person's own words **given in answer to this question**: a questionnaire (including one a group published with the candidate's answers), a moderated debate answer to the question, a first-person issue page on their own site, a signed pledge. |
| `statement-other` | The person's own words matched to the question afterwards: news quotes, interviews, speeches, social posts. |
| `not-evidence` | Scorecard grades, percentages and endorsements; quizzes; voter-guide summaries not in the person's words; encyclopedia or aggregator pages; advocacy-group profiles. |

**Rules**
- A record needs a named instrument. "Voted against clean energy mandates" with no instrument →
  `not-evidence` until the roll call is found. Emit `needs_source` for it.
- **A record reported only by news is not a record (H15).** "She authored Senate Bill 285" or "he
  voted against it", written by a reporter, is the reporter's account of a record, not the record. Code
  that passage by what it is: the person's own quoted words in it are `statement-other`; the
  reporter's account of the act is context for those words, not a `record` passage, and it cannot
  carry `record_kind`. Find the record itself (the bill page, the roll call) and code that instead;
  emit `needs_source` for it. CONFIRM cannot check a record on a news page, because no source profile
  reads records from one.
- **Scorecards (Q9, ruled).**
  - A grade, a percentage or an endorsement is `not-evidence`, and it is not corroboration either.
    A scorecard is another organization's choice of *which* votes count, with hidden weights, and it
    often brings back the party signal.
  - The scorecard **page** is a `pointer`. Follow it to the roll calls it lists, and code each one as
    a record on its own.
- **Pledges (Q8, ruled): `statement-answer`.**
  - The text is the group's, and the person agreed to it, which is how a questionnaire works.
  - It does **not** outrank the person's later words, because it is not a record.
  - The election-cycle rule (V5) applies: a pledge signed three campaigns ago → review.
- **Lawsuits, amicus briefs, signed official letters (Q8, ruled): `record`.** The **legal claim or the
  letter's demand itself** must match the rung clause in V4. A procedural claim (standing, authority,
  a deadline) proves nothing about the policy.
- **Classifying `statement-answer` vs `statement-other`: was there a question?** If the person was
  answering *this* question (a questionnaire item, a moderator's question, their own issue page
  heading), it is an answer. If a curator later decided that the words speak to the question, it is
  `statement-other`. When unsure → `statement-other`.
- When `record` and a statement conflict, the record wins, and the row is coded
  `record-vs-statement-conflict` if the conflict decides the chair.
- **Record fields (0.3).**
  - `record_kind` is one of `vote` / `sponsor` / `author` / `other-act`. Every `record` passage
    carries it — the bill-text page of a vote is `vote` too.
  - `actor_quote` is the words, verbatim, showing this person acted: the Aye/No list segment that
    contains the surname, or the author/sponsor line. If two members on the page share the surname,
    or the surname is a common one (Adams, Walker, Smith …), include the initial or first name (for
    example `Walker G`, or `Watson, R.`).
  - `tally_quote` is the vote count text, verbatim (for example `Ayes Count 29 Noes Count 8`).
  - **They are required per record, not per page (ruling 2026-09-26).** All `record` passages on one
    `instrument` are one record. At least one of them carries `actor_quote`; for a vote, at least one
    carries `tally_quote`. Put each fact on the page that prints it: `actor_quote` and `tally_quote`
    on the vote page, `provision_quote` on the page that prints the provision (usually the bill
    text). A page that does not print a fact carries `null` for it — never copy a fact onto a page
    that does not show it.
  - **An amending bill's page keeps deleted text fenced as `[deleted: …]` (amendment-markup spec
    2026-09-27 §2).** That text is removed from the law — it is never the provision, and never
    quoted as `provision_quote`. A bill's effect is the added text plus the unchanged text.
- `instrument` names the bill and the session (for example `SB 1174 (2023-2024)`); every page of
  one record must name the same instrument.

**Worked example — a vote is two passages.** The vote page names the voter and the count but not
the provision; the bill text prints the provision but names no voter. Both are in `rests_on`.

| field | vote page (`billVotesClient`, SB 1174) | bill text (`billNavClient`, SB 1174) |
|---|---|---|
| `v3_class` / `record_kind` | `record` / `vote` | `record` / `vote` |
| `instrument` | `SB 1174 (2023-2024)` | `SB 1174 (2023-2024)` |
| `actor_quote` | `Ayes Archuleta, Ashby, … Dodd, Durazo` | `null` |
| `tally_quote` | `Ayes Count 30 Noes Count 8` | `null` |
| `provision_quote` | `null` | `A local government shall not enact or enforce any charter provision, …` |

**Good.** "H.R. 8035, Ukraine Security Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2024 — Yea", from the Clerk's
roll call. → `record`.

**Hard [real].** Blake Moore / `taxes`: the ATR Taxpayer Protection Pledge. → `statement-answer`
(Q8). The pledge commits against *any* net tax increase. It can therefore evidence a "no tax increases" rung, but
it cannot choose between rungs that differ on *which* cuts.

**Bad [real].** Blake Moore / `climate-change`: "scored 0% from the League of Conservation Voters" +
the LCV scorecard page. → `not-evidence`. The same row's own quote ("if there needs to be some type of
tax incentive to make sure that they can be on the grid") leans *toward* subsidy, not toward S1 rung 4
("let market forces drive"). A coder that leans on the scorecard reaches the opposite reading from the
person's own words.

**Bad [real].** Blake Moore / `civil-rights`: an advocacy group's lawmaker profile and a
legislator-directory page. → both `not-evidence`.

---

### V4 Shape — *what can this passage prove?*

This variable is the core of the codebook. The stance-program pass-1 measurement is the reason:
*shape*, not type, predicted which chairs survived audit (authored bill 67%, co-authored 40%, bare vote
0%, statement alone 0%).

| Value | Definition | Can support a chair? |
|---|---|---|
| `chair-shaped` | The operative content matches **every clause** of one rung and excludes the adjacent rungs. | yes |
| `direction-only` | It shows for/against but does not separate the rungs on that side. | no |
| `multi-subject` | A vote on a bill with many unrelated parts (omnibus, budget, appropriations, reconciliation). | only via the vote ladder |
| `procedural` | Cloture, rule, table, recommit, previous question, adjournment. | no |
| `study-directive` | It orders a study, task force or report. | no |
| `near-unanimous` | Fewer than 10% of the body voted against. | no, alone |
| `rhetorical` | Real and attributed, but it names no policy clause ("hateful and divisive"). | no |
| `off-axis` | It speaks to the topic along a dimension the ladder does not order. | no |

#### V4.1 The vote ladder (ruling 2026-09-25)

A vote does not mean support for every clause of a bill.

| Vote | Can prove |
|---|---|
| Amendment / motion to strike / divided question on **the specific provision** | a chair |
| Final passage of a **single-subject** bill whose operative section matches the rung | a chair |
| Final passage of a **multi-subject** bill | direction at most. It proves a chair **only** if the person's own statement ties their vote to *that provision* (an explanation of vote, a floor speech). |
| **No** on a multi-subject bill | nothing. They may have objected to any part. |
| Procedural | nothing about the policy |

- A coder citing a vote must fill `provision_quote`: the operative text it relies on, verbatim from a
  snapshot. The gate rejects the label if the text is not in the snapshot.
- **The operative section governs, not the recital or the short title** (C38, C51).
- **A study directive that states its goal (H16, ruling 2026-10-02).** A vote for a study does not say
  what the person hopes it finds, so a study directive is never a chair. Which blank it gives depends
  on the bill's own text:
  - The text states no outcome ("study X and report") → the row is BLANK `no-evidence`.
  - The text states the outcome it seeks — findings that endorse a side ("the Legislature endorses a
    health care system with unified financing, such as a single-payer health care system"), or a
    study ordered "with the objective of creating" a named policy → BLANK `direction-only`, on that
    side. It applies to anyone who acted on the bill, because the stated goal is in the text they
    voted for; it is clearest for the author.
  - This does not let a recital carry a chair: the operative section still governs what the bill
    does, and the stated goal shows only a side.
- **Sponsorship evidences the bill as filed** (C37). If the bill was amended out of shape, code the
  version the person acted on.
- A vote whose `tally_quote` shows fewer than 10% No is `near-unanimous` and cannot carry the chair
  alone; a claimed vote with no vote page (for example a bill that died in committee) is not a vote.

#### V4.2 Clause completeness

- **Compound rungs need every clause evidenced** (stance-program §4.2). Rung 3 of `social-security`,
  "small adjustments to **both** benefits **and** taxes", needs evidence on both.
- **Broader than the instrument** (stance-program R3): an ADU-only bill cannot evidence "upzone broadly
  to allow multifamily by right". Seat the narrower rung if one exists; otherwise BLANK.
- **Silence is not a clause** (gold round 5, 2026-09-30). When a rung's clause is a limit or its
  absence ("at every stage, with no time limit", "without exceptions"), the instrument must *say* it.
  A text that declares a right and names no limit has not said "no limit"; it has said nothing about
  limits, and other law may still set them. → `direction-only`.
- **Ruling out the other rungs is not evidence for the one left** (gold round 5, 2026-09-30). "Not
  rung 1 (nothing is required), not rung 3 (the law changes), so rung 2" establishes only a side. The
  remaining rung still needs its own clauses matched — a repeal that *permits* a programme does not
  "strengthen enforcement". This is the same fault as reaching for "the least extreme option the
  reasoning supports" (CLAUDE.md): a tiebreaker, not evidence. → `direction-only`, or
  `compound-partial` when the rung is compound and one clause is met.
- **The rung's object is a clause (H17, ruling 2026-10-02).** A rung says *what* the government acts on,
  not only *how*. A mandate with a firm deadline matches the mechanism of `climate-change` rung 1,
  "Require a shift to **clean energy** through mandates and firm deadlines", only when the thing it
  mandates is clean energy.
  - A renewable-procurement standard with dated targets ("44 percent by December 31, 2024 … 60 percent
    by December 31, 2030" of retail sales from eligible renewable resources) → rung 1, `chair-shaped`.
  - A greenhouse-gas emissions limit ("reduced to at least 40 percent below … no later than December
    31, 2030"), or a declared net-zero policy that names carbon capture and removal as paths, names no
    energy source; it can be met in other ways → BLANK `direction-only` (the pro-action side).
  - The same test applies on every ladder: match the rung's object, not only its verb.

**Good (calibration A1).** A prime-sponsored bill that *is* "a moratorium on new data centres until the
utility commission reports". Rung 1 is a moratorium. → `chair-shaped`.

**Good [real].** J. Stuart Adams / `trans-athletes`. He led the 2022 Senate vote to override the
governor's veto of HB11, a single-subject bill barring transgender girls from girls' school teams.
S1 rung 4: "require transgender athletes to compete only on teams matching their biological sex
assigned at birth."
- The instrument's operative content is rung 4.
- Rung 5 (a total ban from all sport) is excluded by the bill's own text.
- → `chair-shaped`. (Check under V5: the act is in-term.)

**Hard [real].** Blake Moore / `ukraine-support`. Yea on H.R. 8035, a Ukraine-specific supplemental
appropriation, plus his statement that it is "squarely in our national interest".
- The bill is single-subject enough (Ukraine aid) → `chair-shaped` for *continuing aid*.
- The rung-2 vs rung-1 boundary is "current levels" vs "increase". The coder must check that the
  supplemental's size and the rung's magnitude line up.
- If the annex does not settle whether a supplemental is "current level", code BLANK
  `direction-only`. **This is the example to rule on for the annex.**

**Hard [real].** Burgess Owens / `redistricting`: a filed federal lawsuit arguing the Elections Clause
gives map-drawing "exclusively to state legislatures". → `record` (Q8), and the claim in the
complaint is itself the position (a substantive claim, not a procedural one). It is `chair-shaped` if rung 5 says "legislature alone draws the
maps". The coder quotes the complaint's claim as `provision_quote`.

**Bad [real] — the omnibus trap.** Mike Kennedy / `school-vouchers`, published as rung 5 (universal
vouchers). The basis is a Yea on the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (July 2025), a reconciliation bill
covering taxes, Medicaid, immigration enforcement and more, one part of which created federal
tax-credit scholarships.
- → `multi-subject`. His vote proves nothing about the scholarship clause on its own.
- A tax-credit scholarship is also not "funding follows the student to any school". → `adjacent`
  on V2 as well.
- The row needs his own words tying the vote to that clause, **and** a rung that matches the clause.
  Otherwise → BLANK.

**Bad [real].** Blake Moore / `medicare/aid` and `healthcare`: the same OBBBA vote used as the basis
for two further rungs. → `multi-subject`, both times. The statements in those rows ("sound policy",
defending work requirements) are about work requirements, a narrower clause than either rung. →
`adjacent`.

**Bad (calibration R1).** No on a rebate deal the member disliked. It rules out one end and names no
chair. → `direction-only`.

**Bad (calibration R6).** "Morally wrong… hateful and divisive." It is verbatim and attributed. →
`rhetorical`.

### V5 Time — *does it describe the person's position now, in this role?*

| Value | Definition |
|---|---|
| `in-term` | The act or statement dates from within a term of this office, or from the current campaign for it. **A record** (vote, sponsorship, authorship, a signed act) also counts as `in-term` when it dates from a term in **either chamber of the same legislature** (V5 ruling 2026-09-27, option B). |
| `pre-seating` | A vote or act from before the person held a seat in this body. A record from **another level of government** (a city council, a county, Congress) is valid for that office only. |
| `superseded-by-later` | A later passage from the same person states or acts differently. |
| `undated` | No date can be established. |

**Rules**
- A **record** has no age limit if it is chair-shaped against the served rung text.
- **Earlier chamber, same legislature (ruling 2026-09-27, option B).** A person moves between the two
  chambers of one legislature as the same person, and what they sponsored there is often what elected
  them to the other. So their earlier-chamber records are coded exactly like in-term records: the vote
  ladder (V4.1), the near-unanimous rule and `superseded-by-later` all apply unchanged. Code, not the
  coder, then checks that the earlier term is on file and that the page shows that term's chamber
  (CONFIRM `prior-service-unverified`, `chamber-not-evidenced`). A statement is not a record: the
  election-cycle rule below still decides it.
  - **[real]** John Kavanagh / `school-vouchers`: co-sponsored and voted for AZ HB 2853 (2022) in the
    House; a State Senator since 2023. → `in-term`; code the act on its content.
  - A record from a **different level** (city council → legislature, legislature → Congress) is
    `pre-seating`: the levers differ, so the ladder may not apply at the new level (scope is a per-rung
    question). Their **own words** from that time are statements, decided by the election-cycle rule
    below.
  - **A judge's record on a lower court** (ruling 2026-10-01) is `pre-seating` too: a trial court and
    an appellate court are different offices with different levers. It counts for the current seat
    only when the rung's lever is the same at both courts — an opinion that shows the judge's method
    of interpretation, or the judge's own sealing or access practice — and the coder names that lever
    in the note.
  - **Candidates too (ruling 2026-09-27).** A candidate for a seat in a legislature is coded on their
    record from either chamber of that legislature, exactly as a seated member is — a former
    representative running for the senate, say. Earlier service comes from
    `essentials.legislative_service` (CA_0296); CONFIRM checks it the same way.
- **A statement follows the election cycle (Q4, ruled).** It counts only if it is from one of:
  - the current term;
  - the current campaign;
  - the campaign that seated the person in *this* office.

  An older statement is coded, but the row goes to review (`statement-out-of-cycle`). Code, not the
  coder, applies this from the dates; the coder records the date it sees.
- `superseded-by-later` passages are coded but cannot support the chair. The newest evidence governs.
- A person's position change is not an error. The closed season keeps the old chair.
- `undated` statements cannot support a chair. `undated` records are looked up (the instrument has a
  date).

**Hard [real].** Blake Moore / `redistricting`: co-chair of the Better Boundaries campaign in 2017,
before he was elected in 2020. Campaign work is not a vote, so this is not a pre-seating vote. But it
is 9 years old, and the source is Wikipedia (V3 `not-evidence`). Find his own recent words; the 2017
role alone → review.

**Hard [real].** Celeste Maloy / `same-sex-marriage`: in a 2023 candidate debate she said she "would
have voted yes" on the Respect for Marriage Act. → `own-words`, `statement-answer` (an answer to a moderator's question in a debate; if the only source is an article paraphrasing it, `statement-other`), pre-seating by
construction (she was a candidate). A hypothetical vote on a named instrument is a strong statement:
the instrument's **operative** content is the position. The RFMA's operative section is marriage
recognition; its religious section saves protections that already exist, so it does not show that she
insists on a carve-out (V4.1: the operative section governs). → Season 2 rung 2, "the same benefits
and protections as any other marriage", unless her own words stress the religious exemption (ruling
2026-10-01). It is `in-term` for the campaign that seated her. Note: the served ladder changed between
Seasons 1 and 2, and her Season 2 value differs. Re-code it against the served S2 rung text; do not
carry the S1 reading forward.

### V6 Chair — *which rung does the surviving evidence establish?* (row level)

**Values:** `1`–`5`, or `BLANK` with exactly one reason:

| BLANK reason | Use when |
|---|---|
| `no-evidence` | No passage survived V1–V5. |
| `direction-only` | The surviving passages separate the sides but not the rungs on one side. |
| `adjacent-chairs` | Surviving passages establish two different rungs (stance-program R4). |
| `compound-partial` | The best rung is compound and only some of its clauses are evidenced. |
| `record-vs-statement-conflict` | The record and the statement point to different rungs, and the record is not itself chair-shaped. |
| `scope-unavailable` | This level is **not asked** this topic or rung: a named exclusion (no `compass_topic_roles` row for the level, or the annex rules the office out). Normally dropped before coding. Since 2026-10-06 the lack of a lever alone is **not** this reason: own words can still seat the chair (V2 "No-lever level"). |

**Rules**
- **`rests_on`** lists the snapshot IDs whose passages establish the chair. At least one is required
  for a numeric chair.
- **Reasoning:** 1–3 sentences that name the instrument or quote the words, and that cite the rung by
  its **text**, not by its number.
- **One instrument can establish chairs across a whole body** (calibration A4) — but only after a
  cohort pass shows the members are not being separated by language that separates nobody.
- **Party inference is a bad code** wherever it appears.
- **Evidence tier (ruling 2026-10-06, Chris Andrews; option C).** One chair-shaped source is enough to
  seat a chair, but the voter sees how much evidence stands behind it. The tier is **computed by code
  from the row's `rests_on`, never coded**:
  - `corroborated` — at least two **independent** sources in `rests_on`, each of which on its own
    supports the chair (its passage is `chair-shaped` for that rung, or, for a vote, passes the V4.1
    vote ladder for it).
  - `single-source` — anything else that seats a chair.
  - **Independent** means a different instrument (record passages on one instrument are one source —
    the instrument group of V3), or a different occasion of the person's own words. Two reports of one
    statement, or news repeating one press release, are one source (principle 6).
  - **Two statements on one day (ruling 2026-10-06, Chris Andrews).** A date is not an occasion: a
    debate answer and a questionnaire on the same day are two occasions. Two same-day statements count
    as two sources only if (1) both are the person's own words on a first-party page, not news or a
    pointer; (2) they are on different snapshots; and (3) their texts do not overlap — one page does
    not reprint the other's words. News on that day adds no source.
  - _owed:_ whether the person's own explanation of a vote counts as a second source for that same
    vote, or as the same act. Until ruled, it is the same act (one source).
  - A tier never upgrades a blank: two `direction-only` sources are still BLANK `direction-only`.
- **Evidence basis (ruling 2026-10-06, Chris Andrews; option B).** Computed by code, never coded, from
  `compass_topic_roles.evidence_basis` for the topic at the seat's level (CA_0302): `record` (the
  level holds a lever) or `own-words` (it holds none). It is not shown to voters: they see the sources
  (the evidence chain). It splits the reliability strata — a certification measured on `record` rows
  never covers `own-words` rows — and an own-words chair goes to review until its own stratum is
  certified. A chair from own words is compared with the voter's view like any other chair.

**Good (calibration A3).** A council appointee's vacancy-application packet, published by the city,
answers the ladder's question in his own words. It matches one rung clause for clause. → that rung.

**Hard [real].** Celeste Maloy / `social-security`. Her 2024 voter-guide answer supported "gradually
raising the retirement age"; in 2026 she said "everything's on the table", including lifting the cap.
- The first statement is benefit-side only.
- The second is `rhetorical`: "on the table" is not a position.
- S1 rung 3 ("small adjustments to **both** benefits **and** taxes") is compound.
- → BLANK `compound-partial`. Rung 4 is not established either: "raise the retirement age" is
  one clause of rung 4, and "reduce benefits for higher earners" is unevidenced.

**Hard [real].** Burgess Owens / `social-security`: co-sponsored the Social Security Fairness Act
(repealed WEP/GPO, a benefit expansion for a specific group) and said lawmakers "must be willing to
reform" the program.
- The Act increases benefits for one group and has no tax side.
- Rung 3 is compound (benefits and taxes); rung 2 is "increase benefits modestly **while** raising
  taxes on higher earners".
- → BLANK `compound-partial`.

**Bad [real] — party inference.** Celeste Maloy / `trans-athletes`. Basis: "voted with the Republican
caucus on this party-line vote. She has not expressed any dissent." Neither cited source is the roll
call.
- → Every passage fails V1 (no own act in the snapshot), and the reasoning uses the caucus as evidence.
- → BLANK `no-evidence`. The right fix: fetch the Clerk's roll call for H.R. 28 (2025), which is
  single-subject and `chair-shaped` for rung 4. It would then be a good example.

**Bad [real].** Mike Kennedy / `voting-rights`. The SAVE Act requires documentary proof of citizenship
to *register*. S1 rung 4 is "require photo ID for **voting** and regularly update voter rolls". Proof
of citizenship at registration is a different clause. → V2 `adjacent`, V6 BLANK `no-evidence` (or the
annex adds a rung that names it).

## Part B — Quote variables

These variables apply to every **candidate quote** the collector surfaces, for Read & Rank and for the
"Why this position?" citation.

### V7 Tier — *what does the quote commit the speaker to?*

The vocabulary is the on-the-record evidence program's.

| Value | Definition |
|---|---|
| `lever` | It names a means that passes **both** T1 and T2, below. |
| `direction` | A contestable lean whose means fails T2 ("remove regulations", "be tougher on…"). |
| `none` | A shared goal, a diagnosis, a record or accomplishment, a complaint, biography, a slogan. |

**The lever tests (Q5, ruled 2026-09-25).** Name the goal the quote serves, then apply:

- **T1, the opponent test:** could a candidate *who holds the same goal* reasonably choose a different
  means? If not, the "means" is the shared goal phrased as an action → `none`.
- **T2, the accountability test:** could a voter later check whether the person *did it*? If not, the
  means is too vague to hold anyone to → `direction`.

A quote is `lever` only if it passes both. When the lever names a specific instrument (a law, a rule,
a program, an agency action, a waiver, a budget line), also set `v7_flag = "lever-named"`. That tag
is useful for display and for chair evidence; it is not required for rankability.

This settles the disagreement between PRINCIPLES.md:139 ("build shelters" is a lever) and the
decomposition spec (broad actions are not instruments):
- "Build shelters" passes T1 (an opponent can prefer housing first) and T2 (shelter beds can be
  counted) → `lever`.
- "Build more housing", where every candidate says it, fails T1 → `none`.
- "Triple housing construction" fails T1 (a target on a shared goal) unless the passage names how →
  `none`.

T1 is relative to the question and the race, not to the words. The coder uses the other candidates'
passages when the collector supplies them; otherwise it sets `v7_flag = "lever-unclear"`.

**Graded examples [real, `essentials.quotes`, Steve Hilton unless noted]**

| # | Quote (short) | T1 | T2 | Code |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | "repeal the low-carbon fuel standard… change the refinery regulations" | yes | yes | `lever`, `lever-named` |
| 2 | "a waiver from the Medicaid IMD rule that stops any institution with more than 16 beds…" | yes | yes | `lever`, `lever-named` |
| 3 | "instructing the California Department of Geologic and Energy Management to… issue permits" | yes | yes | `lever`, `lever-named` |
| 4 | "it is illegal to live and camp on the streets. We need to enforce the law… drug treatment… cannot be a choice" | yes (vs Becerra's "Housing First approaches… paired… with treatment") | yes | `lever` |
| 5 | "If a community doesn't want a data center, there shouldn't be someone forcing that data center in there" | yes (vs state siting authority) | only if the passage says how (e.g., a local veto) | `direction` as quoted |
| 6 | "We could get that back by removing regulations" (AI) | yes | no — which regulations? | `direction` |
| 7 | "Government's role is to facilitate rather than provide…" (childcare) | yes | no | `direction` |
| 8 | "common sense on climate change, not ideology" | — | — | `none` |

⚠ **Two currently selected Read & Rank quotes code as not rankable** under this rule:
- climate-change: #8;
- economic-development: "California's policy regime should be unequivocally on the side of job- and
  wealth-creators" → `direction`.

A quote re-audit should review them. This codebook does not change them.

**Good (lever).** "We must build much more housing. That includes… deed-restricted affordable,
market-rate, social housing, and shelters." (PRINCIPLES.md). The second sentence names the means, so
keep both sentences in the quote.

**Hard [real, tier_gold_v1].** "I actually really believe in shelter and shelter is an urgent
response. We've tripled the number of shelter beds…" The labeler wrote: "a mix of record and beliefs.
I'm saying lever, but I'm not sure." Under the test: "shelter as the urgent response" is a means an
opponent (housing-first) rejects → `lever`. The "tripled beds" clause is record → it does not add to
the tier.

**Hard [real, tier_gold_v1].** "I've… created the first real performance data… on our homelessness
system." The labeler hesitated between direction and lever. Under the test: "manage by performance
data" is a means few would reject → `direction`.

**Bad → none [real, tier_gold_v1].** "We only have a third of the shelter that we need…" A diagnosis.
The labeler: "more complaining" than proposing. → `none`.

### V8 Quotable — *may this quote be shown?*

`yes`, or one or more reason codes. The codes are the `audit-quotes` check IDs, so the two systems
share one vocabulary.

| Code | Meaning (full rule in `audit-quotes/CHECKS.md` §4) |
|---|---|
| `not-forward` | Record or retrospective, not what they would do. |
| `is-attack` | Attacks a person rather than a policy or office. |
| `off-question` | Does not answer the ranking question (not the topic label). |
| `misleading-verbatim` | Word-for-word, but the cut changes the meaning in context. |
| `source-not-an-answer` | Curator-extracted from a passage that was not an answer to this question. |
| `deid-dishonest` | The blind version changes the position, or hides a load-bearing identity. |
| `non-differentiating-goal` | V7 = `none` because of a shared goal. Flag for a human; do not gate. |

**Rules**
- The quote must be verbatim in its snapshot. That is a code check, not a coder judgment.
- Trimming follows `publish-quotes/EDITORIAL.md`: marked cuts `…`, inserts `[ ]`, no reordering, no
  cut of a load-bearing qualifier.
- A quote can be quotable for the "Why this position?" citation and still not rankable in Read & Rank.
  Rankable needs V7 = `lever` (and a certified quote stratum before any auto-promotion).

## Part C — Per-topic annex (template + one example)

One file per open-season topic: `docs/codebook/annex/<topic_key>.md`. Written against the **served**
revision. A new revision gets a new annex version.

**Template**

```
# <topic_key> — served revision <id> (Season N)
Orientation: standard | inverted | off-axis — one sentence why.
Levels with a lever: federal / state / local / school — records and own words count here
Asked at: every level unless excluded (compass_topic_roles); a level asked but not listed above is own words only
Synonyms: statute or program names the state uses for this topic (e.g. "Medical Assistance Program" for Medicaid in Maryland)
Per rung:

## Part D — Hard-case register

Every row where the coders split, or where a person's blind answer differed from their final one,
adds an entry here: situation → code → rule → gold item ID. Items listed here are
`excluded_from_cert` (leakage).

| H13 | A declared right with no stated limit coded as the "no limit" rung | V4 `direction-only` | V4.2 "Silence is not a clause" | gold round 5 (item withheld; coded before this entry) |
| H14 | A chair reached by excluding every other rung, with the remaining rung's clause unmatched | BLANK `direction-only` / `compound-partial` | V4.2 "Ruling out the other rungs" | gold round 5 (item withheld; coded before this entry) |
| H15 | A news sentence that reports the person's vote or authorship, coded as a `record` | the quoted words → `statement-other`; the reported act → context only, `needs_source` | V3 "A record reported only by news" | gold round 14 (items withheld; coded before this entry) |
| H16 | A study directive whose findings or stated objective endorse a side, coded `no-evidence` | BLANK `direction-only` (a study with no stated outcome stays `no-evidence`) | V4.1 "A study directive that states its goal" | gold round 15 (item withheld; coded before this entry) |
| H17 | An emissions limit coded as `climate-change` rung 1 ("a shift to clean energy") | BLANK `direction-only`; a renewable-procurement standard with dates stays rung 1 | V4.2 "The rung's object is a clause" | gold round 17 (items withheld; coded before this entry) |

- A `record` passage (`v3_class = "record"`) requires `record_kind`. Per instrument group (all
  `record` passages of the row on one `instrument`), at least one passage carries a non-empty
  `actor_quote`, and a group that is a `vote` has at least one non-empty `tally_quote` (ruling
  2026-09-26). `actor_quote` and `tally_quote`, when present, are verbatim in their snapshot.

Question: What role should artificial intelligence play in classrooms and student work?
  1. Prohibit artificial intelligence tools in student work and classroom instruction
  2. Restrict artificial intelligence to teacher planning and administrative use, keeping it out of student work
  3. Permit students to use artificial intelligence on designated assignments, with disclosure required
  4. Encourage broad classroom use of artificial intelligence with light guidelines and teacher discretion
  5. Let teachers and students use artificial intelligence freely, without restrictions

#### Annex

# education-ai — served revision c6a2c643-aaa3-4d91-958e-e17f421b7dc9 (Season 2)

**Status:** draft (2026-10-01). Lines marked _(proposed)_ are a drafter's reading, not yet ruled;
lines marked _(ruled 2026-10-01)_ carry an operator ruling (Chris Andrews). No
`_owed:_` line is open.

**Question:** "What role should artificial intelligence play in classrooms and student work?"

**Orientation:** standard. Rung 1 prohibits AI in schools, rung 5 allows it with no restriction. The
rungs order **how much classroom and student use is allowed**: none, staff only, designated
assignments with disclosure, broad use with light rules, free use.

**Levels with a lever:** school, state. The lever is the school board's
policy (acceptable use, academic integrity, device and network rules) and state statute or
state-board rules. A city or county council holds none → own words only there _(proposed)_.

**Asked at:** federal, state, local, school (`compass_topic_roles`, CA_0302). Own words only at: federal, local (codebook V2 "No-lever level").

**Synonyms:** "generative AI", "large language model", "chatbot", "AI tutor", "acceptable use
policy", "academic integrity", "AI disclosure", "AI literacy", "AI guidance", "responsible use".

1. **"Prohibit artificial intelligence tools in student work and classroom instruction"**
   - Means: AI is banned both from what students produce and from teaching in class.
   - Operative clauses: [a] banned in student work; [b] banned in classroom instruction. Compound:
     one side only → `compound-partial` (V4.2).
   - Establishing evidence looks like: a policy or statute that bans AI tools for students **and** for
     classroom instruction.
   - Levels that hold a lever: school; state.
   - Known chair-shaped instruments: _(none on file)_.
   - A ban on student use that is silent on teachers cannot separate rung 1 from rung 2 →
     `direction-only`.
   - **Blocking AI sites on district networks and devices** is a ban in practice for students; it
     says nothing about instruction → [a] only _(proposed)_.

2. **"Restrict artificial intelligence to teacher planning and administrative use, keeping it out of
   student work"**
   - Means: teachers and staff may use AI for planning and administration; students may not use it
     for their work.
   - Operative clauses: [a] staff use allowed for planning and administration; [b] no student use.
     Compound: one side only → `compound-partial`.
   - Establishing evidence looks like: a policy that permits staff use **and** bars student use.
   - Levels that hold a lever: school; state.
   - Known chair-shaped instruments: _(none on file)_.
   - Commonly confused with rung 1: see rung 1.

3. **"Permit students to use artificial intelligence on designated assignments, with disclosure
   required"**
   - Means: students may use AI only where the assignment allows it, and must say when they did.
   - Operative clauses: [a] student use only on designated assignments; [b] disclosure required.
     Compound: one side only → `compound-partial`.
   - Establishing evidence looks like: an academic-integrity or acceptable-use policy with both
     clauses.
   - Levels that hold a lever: school; state.
   - Known chair-shaped instruments: _(none on file)_.
   - A disclosure or citation rule with no limit to designated assignments meets [b] only →
     `compound-partial`.

4. **"Encourage broad classroom use of artificial intelligence with light guidelines and teacher
   discretion"**
   - Means: schools promote wide use of AI in class, with a few rules and room for each teacher to
     decide.
   - Operative clauses: [a] broad use encouraged; [b] light guidelines; [c] teacher discretion.
   - Establishing evidence looks like: a policy or own words that promote classroom use and leave
     the limits to teachers under general guidance.
   - Levels that hold a lever: school; state.
   - Known chair-shaped instruments: _(none on file)_.
   - Commonly confused with rung 3 because teacher discretion can include "designated" assignments.
     If the policy requires disclosure and limits use to assignments the teacher designates → rung 3.

5. **"Let teachers and students use artificial intelligence freely, without restrictions"**
   - Means: no limits on AI use by teachers or students.
   - Operative clauses: [a] free use by teachers and students; [b] no restrictions.
   - Establishing evidence looks like: own words or a policy that rejects any restriction. [b] is an
     absence clause: a district with no AI policy has not said "no restrictions" (V4.2 "Silence is
     not a clause").
   - Levels that hold a lever: school; state.
   - Known chair-shaped instruments: _(none on file)_.
   - Commonly confused with rung 4 because broad use with few rules reads like free use. Any
     guideline at all → not rung 5.

**Hard cases:**
- **A state law that requires each district to adopt an AI policy**, without saying what it must
  contain, decides that districts decide → `adjacent` (V2, H12) _(ruled 2026-10-01)_.
- **State guidance, task forces and pilot programmes** → `study-directive`.
- **Teaching about AI** (AI literacy, computer science standards) is not use in student work →
  `adjacent` _(proposed)_.
- **Student data privacy** rules for AI vendors, and **AI-generated images** of students (deepfakes)
  → `adjacent`.
- **Buying an AI tutoring product** → `direction-only` toward rungs 3–5 _(proposed)_.
- **Phone or device bans** that do not name AI → `adjacent`.
- **Budget or omnibus votes** → V4 `multi-subject`.

Recent investigations have documented how companies including Google, Microsoft and Apple have funded teacher training, supported courses and front organizations that advance their interests, and built influence throughout the education system. The same pattern is now being used to rush artificial intelligence into classrooms before anyone knows what it will do to learning, critical thinking or child development. As governor Steve Hilton will draw a clear line between the companies selling classroom technology and the people deciding what - and how - children learn. STEVE’S PLAN WILL: Bar technology companies and the organizations they fund from setting academic standards, writing curricula, designing teacher training or shaping state education policy. Require organizations advising California education officials to disclose their corporate funding and financial relationships. Big Tech-backed groups should not be presented to parents and policymakers as independent experts. Stop companies from using branded courses and teacher training as marketing. Vendors would be able to explain how to operate a product after a school has purchased it, but they could not use training programs to shape teaching methods or create demand for their products. Require independent evidence and testing before major new technology is introduced into California classrooms. Schools and parents should be told what evidence shows that the product improves learning, what student information it collects and how much it will cost. Pause the adoption of AI in California schools until a full independent review, to report by the summer of 2027, recommends clear guidelines, including the appropriate grade level for AI to be introduced into the classroom. The review will include public hearings in every county and take evidence from experts and interested parties from around the world, to make sure that California sets the global standard for the use of AI in education. Technology that is genuinely useful, and which supports human flourishing, will still have a place in California schools. But dehumanizing technology that impedes learning and development will be banned, and Big Tech will no longer be able to sell products to schools as well as writing the rules. ← Back to all policies

We have incredible weather, beaches, lakes, mountains, parks, food, music and people from every part of the world. Yet the killjoy politicians and bureaucrats who run state and local government too often seem determined to stop anyone from enjoying it. Want to put on a band at a small venue? Get ready for permits covering entertainment, dancing, sound, alcohol and zoning. Want to organize a block party or street festival? You may have to navigate police, fire, health, public works and alcohol approvals. Want to take your dog to the beach, have a family fire or open a neighborhood gathering place? The answer is often no, or not until you have spent months and thousands of dollars proving that your harmless, fun idea should be allowed. California needs tough rules against real harm. Nobody wants alcohol served to minors, unsafe food, wildfires, wildlife damage, drunk driving or sleepless neighborhoods. But instead of targeting those risks, killjoy politicians and bureaucrats have built a maze of blanket bans, duplicative permits and open-ended delays. Big operators can hire lawyers and consultants. Small businesses, musicians, food vendors, nonprofits, families and volunteers simply give up. The result is emptier downtowns, fewer independent venues, fewer community events and a state that feels more closed and more boring. These killjoy politicians and bureaucrats are crushing the soul and spirit of our state. Their anti-human zealotry has regulated the fun and freedom out of life. STEVE’S SOLUTION: THE OFFICE OF FUN AND FREEDOM As governor, Steve Hilton will create the Office of Fun and Freedom (OFF), a small rapid-action team inside the Governor’s Office. It will not be another sprawling department. Its job will be to get rid of rules, not write new ones. In its first 100 days, the office will conduct a Fun and Freedom Audit of state rules affecting nightlife, live entertainment, community events, food pop-ups, public recreation and social spaces. Every agency will have to identify which restrictions are required by law, which prevent a specific harm and which survive only because nobody has bothered to remove them. Steve will send the Legislature a package to repeal or rewrite the worst of them. OFF will also build one online front door for state event permits and require state agencies to coordinate behind the scenes instead of placing that burden on the public, maddeningly sending people from pillar to post. Routine applications will have firm deadlines, with automatic approval when bureaucrats take too long. For city and county permits, OFF will publish simple model rules, offer technical help and tie relevant state grants to one-stop permitting and reasonable timelines. Communities will keep control over local noise, traffic and public safety, but bureaucracy will no longer get an unlimited veto. A public Fun and Freedom Scorecard will show how long permits take, how much they cost and which agencies are holding people up. We will name and shame the killjoy politicians and bureaucrats. OFF will be judged by how many pointless permits it eliminates, how much time and money it saves, and how many venues and events it helps open. TEN WAYS TO BRING THE FUN BACK 1. LET LOCAL COMMUNITIES DECIDE WHEN LAST CALL ENDS California law currently prohibits alcohol sales between 2 a.m. and 6 a.m. Cities should be allowed to create clearly defined late-night zones where qualified venues can serve until 4 a.m. or even later if there is local approval. Each zone would need a plan for security, noise, transit and safe rides home, with public reporting and the power to suspend the privilege if serious problems develop. This is a local community choice, not a statewide mandate. 2. LET BARS AND RESTAURANTS RUN A NORMAL HAPPY HOUR ABC rules ban free drinks, two-for-one offers and all-you-can-drink promotions. Steve will replace the blanket approach with clear time and quantity limits that allow ordinary promotions, including a complimentary drink or a two-for-one offer, while keeping firm rules against unlimited service, serving minors and serving obviously intoxicated patrons. The state can punish overserving without treating every customer and bartender like a child. 3. CREATE ONE PERMIT FOR LIVE MUSIC AND DANCING Small bars, coffee shops and restaurants should not need a stack of overlapping approvals just to host a band or let people dance. A new Small Venue Permit will combine entertainment, dancing, amplified sound and related local reviews into one application with objective rules and a 30-day deadline. Noise, occupancy, fire safety and closing-hour rules will still apply, but applicants will no longer be bounced from office to office. 4. CREATE ONE APPLICATION FOR BLOCK PARTIES AND STREET FESTIVALS A neighborhood organizer should deal with one lead agency, one application, one payment and one deadline. Police, fire, health, alcohol, street and public works officials will coordinate behind the scenes instead of sending volunteers on a scavenger hunt. Repeat events with a clean record will qualify for a simple annual renewal, and small block parties will use a shorter, cheaper form than major festivals. 5. MAKE FOOD POP-UPS SIMPLE At temporary events, food vendors can face separate health permits even when the event itself already needs approval. California will create one umbrella permit for organizers whose vendors meet standard health rules. Low-risk vendors selling prepackaged or approved cottage foods will use a quick notification process, while higher-risk cooking will still get the inspection it needs. The rule should match the risk, not bury every food booth in the same paperwork. Importantly, it will not be allowed to further entrench the menace of street vendors that are destroying brick and mortar businesses. 6. CUT THE RED TAPE FOR WEDDINGS, FUNDRAISERS AND BEER GARDENS ABC currently requires authorization for every catering event, even when the caterer already holds a state permit and has a clean record. Licensed caterers in good standing will be able to register routine events through instant online notice instead of waiting for another approval. Case-by-case review will be reserved for large or high-risk events, street closures and operators with past violations, with a simpler low-cost path for nonprofit fundraisers. 7. OPEN MORE STATE BEACHES TO DOGS State Parks generally prohibit dogs on beaches unless a location makes an exception. Steve will order a beach-by-beach review and open more sections and off-peak hours where dogs can be accommodated without harming wildlife or other visitors. Clear leash, cleanup and seasonal nesting rules can handle most conflicts. Blanket bans should be the last resort. 8. CREATE MORE PLACES FOR BEACH FIRES AND FAMILY COOKOUTS Too many families arrive at the coast to find that beach fires are prohibited even where a managed fire-ring program could work. State Parks will expand designated fire rings and cookout areas where conditions allow, using reservations, approved fuels, cleanup rules and immediate closures during high fire danger or bad air conditions. Safety changes with the weather and the location. The default should not be a permanent no. 9. GIVE ADULTS LEGAL PLACES TO USE LEGAL CANNABIS INDOORS State law now allows locally approved cannabis cafes, yet the legal path is still closed in much of the state. The Office of Fun and Freedom will provide a ready-to-adopt local ordinance and a fast, coordinated permit for age-restricted licensed lounges and cafes, with worker ventilation protections, no alcohol and strict rules against impaired driving. Local communities will still decide whether to participate. Most communities would much prefer indoor public use rather than the increasingly pervasive stench of weed in public places. 10. MAKE IT EASIER TO OPEN A NEIGHBORHOOD GATHERING PLACE Steve will create a Small Gathering Place rule for independent bars, music venues, coffee shops and community spaces opening in existing commercial buildings. Qualifying projects will get one application, one project manager and a 60-day decision, with by-right approval when objective zoning, occupancy, fire, accessibility and noise standards are met. Vacant storefronts should become places where people meet, not monuments to California’s permitting bureaucracy. RESTORING THE REBEL SPIRIT OF CALIFORNIA The Rebel Spirit of Fun and Freedom is part of the soul of California. Yet it’s being crushed by these endless, bossy, killjoy politicians and bureaucrats endlessly micro-managing every aspect of our lives. Leave us alone! Leave us alone to have fun with our friends and family, to be free, to enjoy our beautiful state! It’s time to fight back against the bureaucratic killjoys. OFF will not only make California more human, it will keeps downtowns alive, support independent businesses, give artists and food entrepreneurs a chance, and give people a reason to get out of the house and spend time together instead of being isolated and stuck to screens. California became the world’s iconic magnet for artists, inventors, rebels and misfits because people came here to create, experiment and live freely. As governor, with the Office of Fun and Freedom in the lead, Steve Hilton will restore the rebel spirit of our state. Tell us which stupid, killjoy rules you want OFF to help get rid of: First Name Last Name Email Phone Tell us what you think the Office of Fun and Freedom should take on. If there is a particular rule, restriction or government hassle behind your suggestion, include as much detail as you can. ← Back to all policies

Saved from https://stevehiltonforgovernor.com/policies/wait-until-8th-for-smartphones (rendered page text, built-in browser, 2026-10-07) POLICY WAIT UNTIL 8TH FOR SMARTPHONES ← POLICY ARCHIVE WAIT UNTIL 8TH FOR SMARTPHONES INTRODUCTION Steve Hilton’s goal is for California to become the world leader in protecting childhood by working towards a voluntary but complete elimination of smartphones for children under 14, in line with the fast-growing “Wait Until 8th” movement which aims to set a social norm that children should not be given smartphones until 8th grade. While there are increasing calls for a complete ban on smartphones - indeed Steve himself floated this idea 11 years ago in his 2015 book ‘More Human’ - a simplistic ban would be neither practical, nor supported by parents and the wider public. THE PROBLEM Smartphones are the scourge of modern childhood. Their vast harms have been well documented, notably by Jonathan Haidt in his recent book ‘The Anxious Generation.’ Children should be connecting and playing with others on a human level, exploring and enjoying the physical world with a sense of fun and adventure, not glued like drones from a dystopian movie to pieces of glass and plastic. Parents instinctively understand this and have been driven to despair by the invasion of toxic technology, wrecking family life, relationships and the simple pleasures of childhood. Not to mention the disastrous impact of smartphones on education and learning. And it is getting worse not better…smartphones, video games, now AI…parents are desperately asking where this is all leading and if it will ever end. Well - the choice is in our hands. With Steve Hilton as governor, parents will no longer be asked to fight this battle one household at a time. Parents who do not want their children to have smartphones feel forced to give in when every other child has one. The companies behind these products know they are addictive and profit from getting children hooked as early as possible. However, current responses to this terrible problem are simply not working. The recent Meta settlement, for example, is a complete waste of time and money. Everyone knows that it will make no real dent in Big Tech addiction and the destruction of childhood caused by the scourge of smartphones. Social media bans, lawsuits, guidelines, exhortations, parental controls will do nothing unless they address the real problem: not the apps but the screens. Specifically, smartphones. Everyone knows that children will find ways to evade measures that aim to manage social media use, just as they are evading Australia's much-hyped social media 'ban' and all the others that have followed. It is time for our society to wake up. We cannot allow children unsupervised access to the internet. It is time to stop the destruction of childhood by focusing on the real problem: smartphones. STEVE’S PLAN WILL MAKE EVERY CALIFORNIA SCHOOL COMPLETELY PHONE-FREE California will adopt a bell to bell ban, strictly enforced. Current state law allows schools merely to limit smartphone use. Steve would require smartphones to be turned off and put away from the first bell to the last, with exceptions only for emergencies, medical needs and disabilities. HELP PARENTS ACT TOGETHER Every class in every school in California will be required to ask all parents to sign a ‘Wait Until 8th’ contract. The default assumption will be participation in the contract; parents will need to proactively opt out. Lists of parents who opt out will be published. A child with a smartphone will be the odd one out. INFORM NEW PARENTS Every maternal and family health provider in California will be required to invite every new parent in California to sign a ‘Wait Until 8th’ pledge. SETTING SOCIAL NORMS IN THE COMMUNITY Any organization receiving funding from the state of California: community groups, after-school clubs, sporting and cultural organizations, faith-based organizations…will be required to commit to a ‘Wait Until 8th’ policy as part of their contract with the state. MAKE BASIC PHONES THE ATTRACTIVE ALTERNATIVE Steve will bring carriers, manufacturers and retailers together to make affordable call-and-text phones widely available and stop pushing full smartphones at young children. Steve will work with the legislature to make knowingly selling smartphones, tablets or other addictive technology to young children a criminal offense. ESTABLISH A CLEAR MINIMUM AGE OF 16 FOR SOCIAL MEDIA Steve will put responsibility on the platforms to keep underage children off their products. This will only work if parents, schools, business and the wider community all move together. The goal is a smartphone-free childhood: a real childhood, to make it normal again for children not to have a toxic, addictive smartphone and to give children time for friends, family, play and the beauty and wonder of the real world. Let’s make California the world leader in making childhood more human. ← Back to all policies

# On the Record — Steve Hilton (9a60d603-194d-410f-ae01-85bd6293f1a7) ## California Governor Debate - CNN (General Election) - OTR page: https://ontherecord.empowered.vote/meetings/5a98c7c9-d215-4c80-b403-844ad39fc5c7 - Video: (no video url) - Date on On the Record: 2026-09-30 - Kind: debate · Debate · - Linked races: bc936a36-287c-4ffd-abd8-5e4fd798bae5, bec5ef3b-095b-4d7d-9117-db81e407cb5e [1:23] I love the way that Javier says the wealthiest are people who are earning less than $150 ,000 a year struggling. But first of all I just want to say thank you to CNN for bringing Javier out of hiding. He's barely been seen in public since the primary four months ago. It's very important we have this debate and the simple point is that the quickest way to get more money in people's pockets is for the government to take less out. That's what I'm going to be doing and it's not coming from the budgets that he describes you know what it's coming from canceling high -speed rail which he's promised to [2:27] So just to be clear you want the people working so hard and barely able to survive I've been in every one of our 58 counties the struggle that people face with the highest cost of living in the country and the highest taxes you want to ask them to continue to pay taxes at same rates? See, again, the misrepresentation. [3:15] happy to talk about that. Javier is right about that. As well as helping working people, [3:23] as well as helping working people, we need to bring jobs back to California. Right now, because of your policies, we have the highest poverty rate and the highest unemployment rate in America. That's because high taxes have driven business out. So we need to incentivize jobs to be created in California instead of sending them to Texas. What I didn't hear was a single thing from Javier about how he would actually help people with the cost of living. And in fact, if we continue with his policies, that's another $11 ,074 a year extra that you would pay [4:52] much more straightforward than I think people realize. There's a couple of simple things that we can do to restore that California dream of home ownership. Number one, the quickest way to reduce the cost of housing is for the government to stop making it more expensive. A recent survey found that the average new home in California is subject to $200 ,000 in government fees and regulations. I'm announcing tonight that I will cap that at $50 ,000. That is $150 ,000 off the price of a new home. Secondly, we need to stop forcing apartment buildings into suburban areas and having all those battles between NIMBYs and YIMBYs when we've got so much space that we could building in in California and then the final part is to build as we used to do in this state the magnificent California dream 10 new cities that's my plan with counties bidding to host the construction of the new communities that will help young people follow their dreams here in California instead of having to move to another state. [6:07] problems Jake is that we've had these kind of top -down targets rather than and they never get met and they make all these promises and exactly as Javier said is the definition of insanity is is doing the same thing and expecting a different result I've got a completely new approach instead of the set of Sacramento forcing this onto communities I want communities to build the housing that meets their needs. [7:09] He hasn't explained how he would actually reduce the cost of housing. We have the highest... No, you didn't. You said that... I would cut red tape. Red tape needs to move fast. What's the track record that you've shown in standing up to the legislature in Sacramento when you were there as attorney general, you did nothing to push back against the and the craziness of that legislature. You can make up the facts. I could get into [7:37] Tell us one thing you did when you were in the, when you were state attorney general to push back against the growth of red tape on housing and everything else. Just one thing. Sure. I [7:47] city [8:18] huntington beach we've got communities up and down the state that want to build but they're being stopped from building by the legislation the regulations and the red tape that his party has put in place. And I said, I would cut the red tape. [8:31] Why should it? It's like your question. The definition of insanity is believing that the people who put the red tape in place are now somehow going to cut it. Gentlemen, [9:10] Well, I think this AI question is actually a different one for California than the rest of the country because these companies are based here and because of the fact that so many businesses have been driven out of the state, our finances are really dependent on these companies. And the problem is that the jobs associated with AI, the high -end manufacturing and infrastructure, that's all going to other states like Texas and Arizona. And the first priority with this industry is to make sure we get all those jobs here in California. The second thing that's very important I think we can all agree on is that this is the least complicated part. At least let's protect children. I think we can all agree on that. And that's why I've said that we should have an immediate pause on AI in the classroom, because right now we're seeing real concerns about something called cognitive stunting, where children's ability to learn is being impeded by AI. In terms of the regulations, I want to make sure that the priority for these companies is safety, making their products safer. Whether that's done by them or we need regulation, we'll see how quickly they act on the promises they've made. [10:28] Well, we'll have to see. They made a number of commitments yesterday. This is very urgent, and I will hold them to that. And as they said in that announcement that they made yesterday, it may require regulation and legislation. I think that should be led in California because this industry is here. You've got a lot of people putting out their opinions on this who really don't know what they're talking about. Here in this state, we lead this industry and I think we need to lead the regulation of this industry as well. [11:48] I just want to ask you a very simple question. How can we possibly trust you on this when you are funded by Big Tech and AI? How much money have you taken from OpenAI and Anthropic? [12:04] much money have you taken from OpenAI and Anthropic? [12:27] you've never done it. [12:28] What I've never done is what you've done in your 36 years as a career politician, where you've never created a job. You've never actually had to make any money of your own. All you've ever done is spend other people's money in every government job you've had. According to your Democrat colleagues, the ones who worked with you, like Susan Rice, who worked with you side by side when you were in the Biden cabinet, she described you as an idiot. She called you bitch ass. Why did Susan Rice, a respected political leader, call you an idiot? [14:42] If you're Javier Becerra and you're the candidate who is supported by the machine in Sacramento, the unions, big business, all these people that for 16 years have given us the highest cost of living in the country, made it impossible to build anything, given us the highest unemployment rate, the highest poverty rate, then we're not going to get the jobs in this state that we so desperately need. And that's why we've got to try something different this time instead of voting for more of the same and expecting a different result. [15:49] is all you can do is point to the same people the same organizations the same policies that have given this state the worst homelessness which you gave Gavin Newsom an A grade for Unbelievably, the highest cost of living, the highest cost of doing anything, the highest unemployment rate, the highest poverty rate. It's impossible for regular working people to live in this state anymore. That's why two million people have left just in the last few years. And all you're offering is more of the same, backed by the same corrupt machine in Sacramento. We've got to change the - I'll let [17:03] Well, as you said, Jake, there is a scope within the law, SB 54, our Sanctuary State Law, as it's known, for there to be cooperation on a long list of categories, specific crimes and specific circumstances. And so I would follow the law. And in fact, my goal here would be to lower the temperature on this whole question. I'm an immigrant. My parents were immigrants from Hungary to England. And so, I want to make sure that we protect our legal immigrant communities and we enforce the law. Everybody agrees that we need secure borders and that we've got to make sure that people who are in this country illegally, who've committed dangerous crimes, should be removed. But that's not happening in California every week, pretty much. We hear horrific stories of crimes that have been committed because of this partisan posturing by the politicians in California that just refuse to follow the law as it's written, even California sanctuary law, which allows for those kinds of criminals to be removed from the country. [18:15] It's about enforcing the law. I mean, the federal law is, immigration law is obviously a federal matter. And my whole aim here would be to lower the temperature. We've got to get this whole debate back to where most people want it to be, which is to prioritize the removal of dangerous criminals. That's not happening in California today and that's because they're playing politics with the issue instead of protecting public safety and that will be my priority. [19:31] You're not enforcing and your party isn't enforcing California law as it is now. And what a disgraceful remark that was. I don't think people want to hear that kind remark in a debate like this and why would you deport every [19:49] said people want to hear it's solutions to their problems not these unpleasant political attacks that don't help anyone immigrant or not with the problems that they're facing the cost of living all of the problems that you have no solutions to whatsoever so all you've got is the talk about your federal politics your All you ever say is Trump, Trump, Trump, and that's nothing but an insult to every Californian who is desperate for something to change in this state and all you're offering is more of the same. Your words, [20:27] Trump, [20:31] That's all you can say on every question because [20:55] Again, because he's got no arguments. Don't try to escape your own words. Because he's got no arguments and no solutions and nothing to say about how he would change anything about how California is run. [22:35] Mr. [22:36] I cannot believe that you're standing there trying to make these arguments. When you were HHS secretary, you were responsible for 479 ,000 unaccompanied migrant children and for their welfare in camps that you ran. You sent them because you dismantled the vetting that should have made sure that they were with a safe, protective family or sponsor, you sent thousands of young children directly into the clutches of child sex and labor traffickers. Hundreds of thousands of children that you were responsible for are still missing today. A hundred thousand of them are under 10 years old. So I cannot believe that you haven't apologized, That you you have any kind of sense of shame or responsibility for what you did to those children and you stand here Lecturing people about immigration when you treated these most vulnerable children unaccompanied children in this way those [24:46] The original investigation that he's now trying to deny was by the New York Times, and it won a Pulitzer Prize. These arguments were made in the primary by other Democrats, including Antonio Villaraigosa, the former mayor of Los Angeles. And you tried the same trick then, to deny responsibility. I cannot believe I've seen the testimony of the victims who were sexually assaulted, and you're proud of putting them into the hands 200 children were sent to one address that turned out to be a contain a lot because you dismantle [26:36] Yes, sensible things that will actually help reduce carbon emissions without hurting every California family and business. For example, it makes absolutely no sense right now to do what we're doing, importing oil halfway around the world from the Middle East and from South America when we have abundant oil reserves here. That actually increases carbon emissions as well as raising gas prices. As long as we're using those energy products in California, let's use what we produce here, which is produced cleaner than anywhere else in the world. Secondly, wildfires. When you have these mega wildfires that burn out of control, they release much more carbon dioxide than is saved by these ineffective and costly climate policies. So we'll have proper forest management to reduce the risk of mega wildfires. That will reduce carbon emissions. And so right through all of these policies, we need to be practical and sensible about these goals rather than just following ideological objectives that increase the cost of living for every California family and business. [28:30] I'm gonna cut the bureaucrats that they've increased in massive numbers that are making everyone's life more expensive and difficult and cancel high speed rail and cancel the payments to nonprofits that are ripping us off when it comes to homelessness. That's how we reduce taxes for every worker. But I just wanna ask you a question about why you're not gonna change. Just look into that camera and tell everyone the national average gas price in America today. [29:01] the [29:40] in Sacramento so that we can give firefighters a tax cut so they're not struggling. Okay, gentlemen, we're gonna [31:25] So Javier gave, when we were asked to give Gavin Newsom a grade on homelessness, he gave him an A. And he's standing there after 16 years where this absolute scandal shames our state saying that suddenly he's gonna go in new direction. This is what's so insulting, actually, about this attitude we get from the Democrats, that just you're going to keep voting for the same thing and you're going to just suck it up because that's what happens in California. We need a plan to change policy for homelessness, not more of the same failed policy. [32:50] I was there in Altadena this week [32:53] and the money that's being withheld is actually the money that Gavin Newsom promised and they said that when you went there, you didn't even, you didn't even bother, you didn't bother to listen, you didn't bother to listen to the stories of local people who feel so terribly let down by the California government. And as usual, all he wants to talk about is federal politics. [35:20] Mr. Helton? I agree that we can't drive more tax revenue out of our state because we need that money here and this initiative would do that. But the priority has to be working people, not just making sure we don't drive the jobs out, but actually we create jobs and that we reduce taxes for people who are struggling. If you earn around $70 ,000 in California just above the typical individual earning, you're paying 9 .3 % tax. That's higher than the top rate in most states. He's got no plans to do anything about that. He's got to help working people. [36:29] votes? As I've said, I've got confidence in what we saw in the primary and in this process, but the thing that I can't believe is the attitude you get from the Democrats who've been running this state about our elections. We just had Karen Bass, the mayor of LA saying, we don't need an election for governor because the Democrat is going to win. And that is the attitude we get from these people who've been in charge of our state for 16 years, and they think that they can just do whatever they want, get whatever bad results, the highest taxes in the country for the worst results, taking everybody for granted, taking their votes for granted. That's why he's not trying to earn anybody's vote. That's why he hasn't been campaigning in this election. They take you for granted. And I just wanna ask every Californian, aren't you tired of that? It's time to try something different Instead of the same thing over and over again. He wasn't even supposed to be the candidate He was the sixth or seventh choice, but they said it doesn't matter as long as it's a D That'll do secretary won't do we need change in, California. Thank you. Just want to try something different. [38:33] Helm There's a majority in this state who agree that it's reasonable to show ID when you vote But the thing that we have to understand is that if we vote just as Javier said earlier if we vote the same way this state as we've been doing we're gonna get the same results and this attitude of just constantly talking about national politics because he's got nothing to offer to change the direction of this state when people are suffering so much and he takes no responsibility for the policies that he supported for the last 16 years of one -party rule is an insult to every California. [44:43] No, I'm pro -vaccine, but I think the data shows, when you look at different ways that this very, very emotional issue for a lot of parents has been handled, particularly since the pandemic, when Javier forced children to be vaccinated, when there was no public health or scientific justification for that whatsoever, forcing little babies and toddlers to wear masks, when there was no justification for that whatsoever, and it's become very contentious. And the evidence shows, as the current head of NIH has made clear, when you look at the data around the world, the places where the requirements, the mandates are lower, are the places where you actually have higher compliance, where parents don't feel that they're being bullied into doing something that they don't want to do. And that's what I wanna see here. [45:40] the law in California, in any case. Well, [45:45] the law much as Javier would like to, I'm sure, in many areas. I would follow the law, and I think that the evidence is that if we can move away from this over -prescriptive attitude where you're telling parents to use so many different vaccines that they're concerned about and actually do it without those kinds of mandates, The evidence from other places is you get higher compliance with the vaccines that are really important for public health. [47:16] guidance to the states? We gave guidance. That's not mandatory. Why did you [47:21] suggest forcefully that children should be given the COVID vaccine? [47:51] When he was HHS secretary, he suggested that children, young children, should wear masks, two and three -year -olds. That's right. mask, there was no public health justification for any of that. He went along with the groupthink. This is why you can't trust him because he's been a bureaucrat and a career politician all his life and he goes along with the groupthink instead of actually standing up for facts and in this case the science. He went against the science and along with the politics and the groupthink. That's why he can't be trusted. [49:16] Yes, and in fact, I will increase affordable, reliable healthcare for Californians. Right now, so many families and individuals have healthcare in name only, where they actually have such a high deductible and such a high premium that it doesn't really mean anything. That's why I've announced my plan for a working class healthcare guarantee that will have a low premium and a low deductible by cutting out the waste and the fraud in the system. The fraud, by the way, that Javier unleashed when he was HHS secretary, he dismantled the fraud unit at HHS. He changed the policy, so that hundreds of billions of dollars were lost in fraud. And when it comes to what he describes as cuts, it shows that first of all, he can't even do math because the amount of money is going up. But secondly, what he's really talking about are work requirements for Medicaid. And the same exact work requirements for Medicaid that have been put in place by the federal government have been matched by Gavin Newsom for the California part of the system. Thank you. So the question for him is, is he going to do that? [51:00] Mr. Helton? If you're against the work requirements, will you then remove them for the California part of the system in the way that Gavin Newsom has imposed them? Will you remove that? [51:45] So you're going to keep the Gavin Newsom [53:19] Mr. Allen, who's been in charge when all those jobs have gone? Donald Trump. When this industry has collapsed. The Democrats, the Democrats in California have run this state for 16 years. He asked me earlier not to interrupt. I see he's not following his own advice. That's okay. [53:36] The Democrats have been in charge for 16 years as the jobs have gone, the industries have gone, and this city, this iconic industry, is on the brink of collapse. And it's the same with so many other industries. Agriculture, which he helped destroy in this state by suing to stop our farmers getting the water that they need. My plan to bring Hollywood home would make us competitive with the best in the world and reduce the bureaucracy and the red tape, which also has been piled on by Javier and his friends. Let me clarify. [56:16] Mr. Hill. Well, none of that is true. What is true is that yet again he's talking as if someone else other than the Democrats, his party and his friends and his legislature in Sacramento that he did nothing to push back against when he was attorney general haven't actually been in charge of California's education system that spends nearly the highest amount in the entire country for some of the worst results. We need reform and change. We need to make sure that every student reads by third grade. We need to use phonics in our school system to teach kids to read. We need accountability for teachers and for individual schools. None of that will happen because he is sponsored by the teacher unions that have been such a big part of the problem in California. [57:27] about him. [57:28] We have some of the worst results in the country after 16 years of Javier and his policies being implemented in California. As you said, Jake, less than half the students read a grade level with math. It's 37%. It's a catastrophe for our young people. We cannot go on like this just as we can't go on with the highest cost of living, with the highest unemployment rate, with the worst homelessness. All of these things are the result of the policies that he wants to see more of. It can't happen in California. We've got to try something different. [58:26] This is the most amazing state in the most amazing country on earth. And it's because we've got this rebel spirit that we do things differently. people build, we can grow anything, build anything, make anything, invent anything. That spirit is being crushed by this bloated nanny state bureaucratic government that Javier has been a part of for 36 years and would continue. It's time to try something different, not least to reduce the cost of living. And so if we have his policies for another four years, the average, the Typical California household will pay $11 ,047 more. If I'm elected governor, the starting point will be to reduce that cost of living. $11 ,000 is what you'd save. And you can check out individually how much you'd save if you go to savewithsteve .vote. It's a practical plan to reduce your costs. And when we do that, we'll make California once again the best place to start and raise a family, to start and grow a business, the best place anywhere in the world.

Life is impossible. [8:50] We have to make these changes because Californians are being crushed by the gas prices, by the gas tax. We have the highest gas tax in the country for the worst roads in the country. And across the board, we have the highest taxes for the worst results. And you know who's really suffering? It's working Californians. It's small businesses. Most of my career has been in business. I know what it's like to try and run a business. The costs that are being imposed on our businesses and our workers in California is just too much. And one way or another, all the Democrats here are part of this system that obviously isn't working. We need common sense solutions. We need practical solutions. Why are we importing oil from 7 ,500 miles away in Iraq rather than using the oil we have here in California? That's the kind of common sense change that as governor, I will be there to persuade the legislature to do. Because they, in the end, want to help Californians too. [10:05] The first point is that to open up California oil production doesn't need the legislature because it's through executive action. The way that they've been closing it down is through an agency of the executive branch called CalGEM, the California Department of Geologic and Energy Management. I would replace the people in there and give them a clear instruction to issue permits to our oil industry to produce oil here in California so we can cut gas prices for California families and businesses. [14:14] No, we cannot keep going in this direction with Democrats constantly going for their insatiable appetite for more and more taxes for their bottomless money pit, and now the mileage tax, they want to track you everywhere you drive. No, I would veto that. We need to cut spending and cut taxes so that we can give relief to families and businesses. My plan is for $3 gas and your first 100 grand tax free. That's what we need to do to make our state Cal affordable. [22:01] Well, by the way, I'd love to be in your class, Katie. If you get a B for what Gavin Newsom's done on homelessness, my goodness, of course it's an F. It shames our state, the situation with homelessness. We have about 10 % of the US population, around 50 % of the country's homeless population. And as for Javier praising Gavin Newsom for the photo op where he tried to pretend he was cleaning up a homeless encampment, literally, Gavin Newsom did that three times in a row. Nothing changed, and nothing will change if you have one of these Democrats in power. It will be more of the same. My plan is a common sense three -point plan. Number one, it is illegal to live and camp on the streets. We need to enforce the law. Number two, we need to get people into the drug treatment that they need, and it cannot be a choice. Number three, we need to get people the mental health care that they need instead of the barbaric situation we have right now in California as a result of these Democrat policies where the main place where we're treating people with mental health problems is jail. That has to change. [23:14] everything has taken us in the wrong direction. That's why we spend, what is it? The state auditor found $24 billion of our money spent on homelessness. They have no idea where it went because it's going into these nonprofits and crony developers that are, instead of solving the problem, they are profiting of these Democrat policies. Okay, Mr. Hilton, thank you. Your time is up, [33:17] One of the proudest days of my life was the day I became an American citizen. It happened in a ceremony right here in San Francisco. So it is a deep honor for me to be endorsed by the President of the United States and here's the thing that's gonna help every Californian when I'm governor is that we will have a constructive relationship and partnership with the federal government which would be the case, I would hope, for any party in that situation so that we can make things better in California, work with the president and his administration to manage our forests better, to harvest the timber so we can build the single -family homes we need for young families, to work to increase California energy production as he wants to do so we can lower gas prices, to fight the fraud in our government so we can cut spending and cut taxes, to work to enforce our immigration laws in all these areas and more. It will benefit every Californian to have a governor who is a partner on these issues with the president and his team. [36:17] that again, Tom. Wait, no, no. Mr. Hilton. [36:24] putting more money into the system. [42:39] So I've discussed this with someone called Marcus Coleman from Bakersfield. His beautiful daughter, Delilah, was put into a coma by someone driving a truck, an illegal immigrant, didn't speak English, and his daughter now disabled for life. That's what we're dealing with here. It is completely ridiculous that we have people driving on our roads who can't understand road signs and can't speak English. So yes, of course, and I've discussed this with my friend, Sean Duffy, the transportation secretary. We will not be issuing commercial driver licenses when I'm governor to people who are illegally here and who don't speak English. That is obvious common sense. [50:46] I will because we've had 16 years of one party rule by these Democrats. It's given us the highest poverty rate, the highest unemployment rate, the highest cost of living in America. It is obviously desperately time for change in California. It's time for some balance in our system. We have to elect a Republican as governor this year. [54:31] We obviously need change in California. The system is not working. I'm the only one here who has never run for office before. I'm not part of this system. These Democrats can't get it done. Matt Mahan talks about his record in San Jose. Actually, homelessness and crime are going up. Javier Becerra talks about his time in government. He thought it was a good idea to put masks on two -year -olds. We need real change in California. We need to think different. We need to vote different. My plan to make our state Cal -affordable is real and serious, and we can get it done if we just vote differently this year. [59:33] Well, if San Jose is the template for housing affordability in California, God help us, it was just rated the least affordable city for housing in the world. That is completely the wrong answer. The right answer is my plan, which was the first plan that I put forward in this campaign. Number one, we have to end this outrageous hidden tax on housing. They call it impact fees. It can add up to 20 % to the cost of a home. Secondly, we have to reduce the extreme environmental regulations that make it three or four times as expensive to build the exact same home in California as in neighboring states. Number three, we have to end the exploitative union lawsuits that are filed to block housing that extract project labor agreements that make the cost so much higher. And number four, we have to end the war on single -family homes so that we can build the housing we need for young families. We need more starter homes in California. [65:54] It's an absolute scandal that we have just under half of our students can read at grade level for math. It's 35%. Here's the plan. We're gonna learn from what works in other states and around the world. The best way to teach kids to read, phonics. We're gonna have that in every school. The most important thing is that you learn to read by the end of third grade. Just as Mississippi has done, we're gonna make sure, we're gonna give you help over the summer if you can't but if you don't meet the test, you repeat the grade and then you can move forward and we're gonna hold teachers and schools accountable for their performance. [70:09] We have to be clear about why they left. They left because of Democrat policies and wrong -headed regulation. Now, some of those mistakes have been corrected. The ability for insurance companies to price in future risk, the ability of insurance companies to account for reinsurance costs, but we still have wrong regulation and this is the three -point plan that I've announced to fix this absolutely massive problem that is crushing so many families across California. Number one, we've got to get people off the fair plan. It was designed for about 100 ,000 people. Now you've got over 600 ,000. We've got to work proactively to get those people onto commercial insurance. Number two, we have to stick to the regulatory framework that was in the original proposition that set up the insurance department. 60 days to make to approve rate changes. Sometimes now it's over a year. And number three, we have to stop these nuisance lawsuits often filed by private equity from out of state that are increasing the cost of insurance. All right, [75:53] So as the father of two teenage children, I know this issue very well. But actually it's an issue that I've been thinking about and advocating on for many, many years. 11 years ago, in my book, More Human, 2015, that was published, I made the argument that it's not just the apps, it's not just the platforms, it's the screens themselves and that we should set a social norm that children under 16 should not have a smartphone. That is my position now. I think that every parent in their heart knows that it's wrong. Kids do not need smartphones and we shouldn't allow it. [76:38] I think it misses the point, honestly. I think that we've got to get to the heart of the problem and that's the devices and the screens. [82:14] In the middle of it right now is Reacher. One of my sons really enjoys that. Probably more than the rest of us in the family but it's been good fun to watch together.
