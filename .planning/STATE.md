# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-26)

**Core value:** Users can explore political issues and discover their elected officials without friction — the experience must feel polished and trustworthy enough to demo confidently.
**Current focus:** Milestone v1.8 — Compass Data & Politician Research (Phase 45 in progress)

## Current Position

Phase: 47 of 50 (Federal Officials Research — plan 01 complete)
Plan: 01 complete
Status: Phase 47 plan 01 done
Last activity: 2026-02-26 — Appended CA US Senator stances: Padilla (21 topics) and Schiff (21 topics); CSV now has 107 rows for 6 officials

Progress: [███░░░░░░░] 20% (1/6 phases complete, 1/6 plans in phase 47)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity (v1.7):** 6 phases, 15 plans, 36 tasks (1 plan deferred)
**Velocity (v1.6):** 7 phases, 11 plans, 23 tasks
**Velocity (v1.5):** 6 phases, 13 plans, 25 tasks

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
See `.planning/milestones/v1.7-ROADMAP.md` for full v1.7 decision history.

- **45-01:** Deleted cmd/seed/main.go stub entirely (not just emptied) — compass_csv_seeder.go already owns func main() in the same package, making the stub a potential build conflict as well as dead code.
- **46-01:** Newsom trans-athletes assigned value 2 (allow with documentation) based on 2023 veto of anti-trans sports ban. Newsom ai-regulation assigned value 3 — vetoed SB 1047 (heavy regulation) but signed 17 AI transparency/safety bills. Kounalakis coverage limited to 10 of 21 topics where documented positions exist.
- **46-02:** Braun ukraine-support assigned value 3 (mixed Senate voting record on aid bills). Braun same-sex-marriage assigned value 4 based on 2022 Politico interview (states should decide). Braun ai-regulation assigned value 1 (deregulatory stance; 1=allow freely on this topic scale). Beckwith coverage limited to 13 of 21 topics. Braun and Beckwith BallotReady external_ids left blank — not locatable via public sources; Phase 50 import will need manual resolution.
- [Phase 47]: Padilla ukraine-support value 2 (supports aid but no documented call for significantly increased levels). Schiff ukraine-support value 1 (Intel Committee chair called for maximum military support). Both senators BallotReady external_ids left blank.

### Pending Todos

- **Future phase idea: Census ZCTA-to-Place ZIP mapping for city council politicians** — All 89 cities in city_sources.json have `place_geoid` and `ocd_id_base` that match 381 LOCAL/LOCAL_EXEC politicians. A script could batch-insert zip_politicians rows. Works for 72 at-large cities; districtd cities would over-show but better than nothing.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 46-48 (research) depends on knowing the current 20 compass topic_keys before producing the stance CSV. Verify topic_keys from DB before starting research.
- Phase 50 (import) depends on Phase 48 AND Phase 49 both completing first.
