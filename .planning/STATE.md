# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-19 after v1.6 milestone started)

**Core value:** Every platform feature can answer "does this user have permission to do X?" with a single join to the appropriate tier table — no flag chains, no application guesses, no partial states.
**Current focus:** v1.6 Platform Consolidation — Phase 34: Database Schema Migration

## Current Position

Phase: 34 — Database Schema Migration
Plan: 01 of 03 complete

Progress: [v1.0 ✅][v1.1 ✅][v1.2 ✅][v1.3 ✅][v1.4 ✅][v1.5 ✅][v1.6 🔄] 33/43 phases shipped ███████░░░

## Accumulated Context

### Key Decisions

Full key decisions log in PROJECT.md. All prior milestone decisions archived in milestones/.

v1.6 constraints and decisions to carry forward:
- **pool.query() for all non-public schema writes** — established in v1.3; every write to essentials/staging/treasury/meetings/validation_quests/trivia must use pool.query(), not PostgREST
- **No nested SECURITY DEFINER calls** — gem/XP writes must be inline in atomic RPCs; established v1.4
- **SET search_path = '' on all new SECURITY DEFINER functions** — established v1.2; fully qualified table refs required
- **Two-pass validation in admin RPCs** — validate all inputs before any writes; established v1.2
- **RLS is primary defense** — EV-Backend tables currently have no RLS; adding RLS is required for every migrated table before any endpoints go live
- **Data import pipelines are out of scope** — Congress.gov, LegiScan, OpenStates are not ev-accounts' responsibility

### Open Blockers

- **Essentials XP provisioning** — `essentials-rep-lookup` XP source not yet in `serviceKeyAuth.ts`; `GEMS_SERVICE_KEYS` env var provisioning needed before first Essentials production award. Deferred to v1.7.
- **EV-Backend Go source access** — Phase 34 schema inspection completed via Supabase MCP (direct DB). Go repo access not required for Phase 34.

### Phase 34 Key Findings (from 34-01)

- **69 tables across 6 schemas** — all RLS off, zero existing grants/policies (clean slate)
- **compass.user_id is text (UUID values)** — RLS policies must use `user_id::uuid = auth.uid()` cast
- **54 public-read / 4 owner-read / 8 authenticated-read** — policy category assignments complete
- **208,101 row baseline** — essentials dominates (206,587 rows); meetings and treasury are empty schemas
- **transparent_motivations.source_audit_log** — authenticated-read despite having `changed_by_user_id uuid` (admin audit log, not owner-scoped)

### Pending Todos

- Confirm access to EV-Backend Go repo and production DB connection string before starting Phase 34.
- Coordinate with Chris Andrews on timing of frontend auth switches (Phase 40) — needs to be a planned cutover, not a rolling change.
